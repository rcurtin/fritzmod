  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameScientificVictoryFlavor">Little remains unknown concerning the role, history, and future of the universe.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameScientificVictoryDefeatFlavor">What is this? Through the study of advanced sciences, another faction has developed to the point that they are the uncontested masters of this galaxy.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameEconomicVictoryTitle">ECONOMIC VICTORY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameEconomicVictoryDescription">Your empire has amassed $EconomicVictoryEconomicVictoryProgress Dust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameEconomicVictoryFlavor">Harnessing the economic power of myriad systems and controlling vast reservoirs of Dust, the galaxy is a great spider's web with you at the center.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameEconomicVictoryDefeatDescription">Another faction has amassed $EconomicVictoryEconomicVictoryProgress Dust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameEconomicVictoryDefeatFlavor">It is too late for you. Another faction has collected Dust to the point where they have an unassailable base of economic power. With luck, you will be able to find a role as a favored servant.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameExpansionVictoryDescription">You have conquered $ExpansionVictoryPercentageOfGalaxyColonized% of the galaxy's systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameExpansionVictoryFlavor">You gaze up at the stars in the sky, and realize that many of them belong to you.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameExpansionVictoryDefeatFlavor">Whether you have struggled hard and achieved your goals is now a moot point. Another empire controls so many of the galaxy's systems that you have no choice but to acknowledge their supremacy and surrender before their legions. Let us hope they do not place their boots on your neck as you bow before them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameSupremacyVictoryTitle">SUPREMACY VICTORY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameSupremacyVictoryDescription">Your empire has conquered the homeworlds of all known factions in the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameSupremacyVictoryFlavor">The night sky contains hundreds of planets and billions of asses, and you have kicked them all.

The secrets of the Endless will soon be yours, and Dust is but one of the many resources under your control.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameSupremacyVictoryDefeatDescription">Another empire has conquered the homeworlds of all the known factions in the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameSupremacyVictoryDefeatFlavor">There are many paths to domination, but the one you chose is apparently a dead end. Another empire has conquered the homeworlds of all the known factions in the galaxy, and now rules supreme through puppet governments. With luck they will exploit you as a useful tool, rather than stamp you out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameScoreVictoryTitle">SCORE VICTORY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameScoreVictoryDescription">At the end of turn $ScoreVictoryGameTurn, your empire has the highest score and has been declared winner.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameScoreVictoryFlavor">It is not a simple thing to be a fair and balanced ruler. The needs of the people, the economy, and military must be weighed against science and exploration. But you have done it; this galaxy is but a great sandbox in which you and your people hold sway. You control the supplies of Dust as well, and with it the keys to the secrets of the Endless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameScoreVictoryDefeatDescription">At the end of turn $ScoreVictoryGameTurn, the faction with the highest score has been declared winner.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameScoreVictoryDefeatFlavor">It is awesome, is it not?

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameWonderVictoryDefeatDescription">Horror! Another faction has built $WonderVictoryWonderVictoryScore times the $WonderVictoryConstructibleName.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameWonderVictoryDefeatFlavor">You have just seen the news. In spite of your best efforts, another empire has built structures of such magnificence that all and sundry stand amazed by their genius.

You have lost, and will soon be reduced to a seldom-clicked link in the hypertexts of history.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameDiplomaticVictoryFlavor">Though the diverse peoples of the galaxy do not necessarily stand united in brotherly love, you have at least created a stable, peaceful environment where trade and science advance to the benefit of all.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameDiplomaticVictoryDefeatDescription">Another empire has accumulated $DiplomaticVictoryDiplomaticVictoryProgress points on the great scales of galactic diplomacy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%EndGameDiplomaticVictoryDefeatFlavor">It is of no use.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionTerDescription">Home Planet Type: Terran
Diplomatic Alignment: Evil
Gameplay: Colonialist
Main Victory Type: Economic/Military
 
The Empire is theoretically under the control of a central monarchy. However, the rate of expansion means that the society cannot be ruled that way effectively. In fact, the systems of the colonial diaspora are colonized by designated Corporations who work hand-in-hand with the Ministry of Investment and Development. The Ministry of Security is involved as well, due to the need for native and/or alien pacification, security forces, defense, and surveillance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameAmoTitle">AMOEBA</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameAmoebaDescription">Eerie creatures from a swampy planet, these diplomats have an uncanny ability to understand their opponents.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionAmoDescription">Home Planet Type: Ocean
Diplomatic Alignment: Good
Gameplay: Exploration, Diplomacy
Main Victory Type: Diplomatic/Military
 
A highly evolved form of a lowly species, these colorful beings come from an ocean world. Evolving slowly over millions of years with plenty of time to philosophize, it is not surprising that the Amoeba are diplomatic, cultural, and intellectual. Wise and urbane, they have an exceptionally high 'emotional intelligence' and are unusually open to other alien and intelligent species. Their goal is to travel, meet, and learn, though their relatively defenseless natural form has bred into them the need to turn all situations to their advantage, and to be in control of their destiny. Though the Amoeba do not feel that their nature is to dominate and conquer, they can be viewed as warriors whose weapons are diplomacy and trade.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameSwaTitle">CRAVERS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameSwarmDescription">They are the Cravers. Everything else is their food.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionSwaDescription">Home Planet Type: Arid
Diplomatic Alignment: Evil
Gameplay: Consume Worlds
Main Victory Type: Military
 
Created by the Endless from an insectoid life form, the Cravers are in the purest sense hunter-gatherers and would never have evolved on their own the processes necessary to raise crops or domesticate animals. Their life cycle is based on consumption, and as such they are capable of digesting any form of plant or animal matter. Once their home world was consumed, they left to seek further nourishment. If they do not continue to expand, discover, and exploit new worlds, their society could literally eat itself to death. Feeding the hive is their all-consuming purpose; the notions of 'treaty', 'trade', and 'peace' do not exist.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameSopTitle">SOPHONS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameSophonDescription">Adept at science and fond of discussion and debate, the Sophons seek knowledge and understanding.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionSopDescription">Home Planet Type: Terran
Diplomatic Alignment: Good
Gameplay: Amazing Scientists
Main Victory Type: Scientific

Curious, analytical, and inquisitive, the Sophons are a people who value knowledge over all. No theory -- or machine -- is so perfect that it can resist a bit of tinkering; advances come both in great leaps and tiny increments. The Sophons travel the galaxy driven by a thirst to discover and understand; they therefore view war as nothing more than a distraction from the serious things in life. However, given their advanced technologies, they can become a surprisingly dangerous foe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameResTitle">PILGRIMS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameResistanceDescription">Curious, adaptable, and restless, this faction seeks the home planet of the legendary Endless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionResDescription">Home Planet Type: Jungle
Diplomatic Alignment: Good
Gameplay: Exploration, Diplomacy
Main Victory Type: Diplomatic/Military
 
A group of scientists and explorers, unhappy with the United Empire, hijacked a mission to an outer planet and set up an independent government. They refused the heavy corporate hand of the Empire, preferring to eke out their living on the edge of known space. Aided by the Sophons, this splinter group grew to become the Pilgrims. Accustomed to orbital living and constant movement, during the early years of their development they had a proportionally greater contact and familiarity with artifacts and remnants left by the Endless. They have come to view the Endless in a religious light, and a goal of their society is to one day discover the planet from which the Endless originated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameHisTitle">HISSHO</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameHisshoDescription">Proud warriors and aviators, the Hissho are primarily interested in the search for honor and glory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionHisDescription">Home Planet Type: Jungle
Diplomatic Alignment: Evil
Gameplay: Conquest, Glory
Main Victory Type: Military/Population
 
The Hissho are a modern and civilized peoples descended from avian DNA. However, they are avian in the way that many species of dinosaur had avian characteristics; in fact, they are not unlike feathered pterodactyls. A race of highly competitive tribal warriors, their history is one of bloodshed, conquest, vengeance, and domination.  While this has created a very hardy, aggressive, and dangerous people, it has also slowed their advancement and limited their numbers. When they did reach the stars to find other peoples waiting for them, their reaction was to conquer and dominate. Their innate and learned sense of flight makes them superlative pilots.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameHorTitle">HORATIO</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameHoratioDescription">Horatio, founder of the Horatio, would beautify the universe by filling it with beings that look like… Horatio.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionHorDescription">Home Planet Type: Arid
Diplomatic Alignment: Neutral
Gameplay: Expand
Main Victory Type: Population/Wonder
 
Incredibly wealthy and only slightly less deranged, Horatio was an Empire trillionaire who left to discover his own star cluster. Finding a planet sprinkled with labs of ancient cloning technology left by the Endless, the boredom soon drove Horatio to create a race of allies, servants, and slaves who were every bit as gorgeous as the most beautiful person in the universe -- Horatio. Once the planet was repopulated, Horatio the First had only to look up, regard the stars, and realize how much more beautiful they, too,  would be if they were filled with... Horatios. The rest, as they say, is history.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameSowTitle">SOWERS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameSowerDescription">Robot builders, the Sowers are on a religious mission to prepare for the return of the long-lost Endless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionSowDescription">Home Planet Type: Tundra
Diplomatic Alignment: Neutral
Gameplay: Construction
Main Victory Type: Wonder/Military
 
The Sowers are a machine race created by the Virtual faction of the Endless. They took from their creators the mission to traverse the universe and make worlds livable and habitable for the arrival – or return – of the Endless. The Sowers come, establish industries, create the basic infrastructure needed to make a wild planet habitable, and move on to the next one. The Sowers are neither hostile nor friendly; they are simply continuing their programming. Any world they arrive on will be harvested and advanced materials will be developed. Any local populations or other peoples will be ignored -- unless they get in the way or oppose the Sowers' holy mission.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNamePirTitle">PIRATES</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNamePiratesDescription">A loose federation of criminal family clans, the ABC is a constant threat to commerce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionPirDescription">Home Planet Type: Various
Diplomatic Alignment: Evil
Gameplay: Annoying
Main Victory Type: Military
 
The universe is full of wealth and riches, and there are those who would rather take what has already been created than do the hard work themselves. While military expeditions generally destroy these bands of pirates or raiders before they become too powerful, one syndicate of pirate-traders, known as ABC (the Autonomous Bastards' Collective), has grown sufficiently large and wealthy to constitute a serious threat to galactic development.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameEmpTitle">SHEREDYN</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionNameEmperorDescription">A loyal elite faction within the Imperial Navy, the Sheredyn fleet has the right to display its traditional colors.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionEmpDescription">Home Planet Type: Terran
Diplomatic Alignment: Evil
Gameplay: Colonialist
Main Victory Type: Economic/Military
 
It would require several centuries of time travel to find the origins of the military organization now known as the Sheredyn Fleet. Originally a bodyguard at the time of the first emperors, over time the Fleet grew to become commandos, special forces operatives, and finally a powerful clandestine force within the military of the United Empire. Almost a caste within the Imperial Navy, admission to the service of the Sheredyn Fleet remains impossible to all but the most qualified candidates. In a society where money means everything, the Fleet retains its image of professionalism. With several lucrative contracts from appreciative emperors, it has grown to have an economic power almost equal to its military reputation.</LocalizationPair>

“Iron and Steel, Blood and Flesh”
 
The Automatons were created by a long dead civilization known as the Reyans, who perished many millennia ago due to uncontrolled industrialization and that caused irreversible damage to the ecosystem and atmosphere of their planet. The Reyans decided to leave a legacy in the form of one of their greatest technological achievements: Highly sophisticated clockwork beings. Within a year of the creation of the clockwork men, the Reyans committed mass suicide so as not to suffer through the effects of a dying planet. They left the Automatons, their greatest creations, alone and lost on the planet.
 
The clockwork creations of the Reyans developed a simple society of their own, until one day a large Endless ship crashed into the planet and spread Dust across its surface. The Dust modified the machines, enhancing their abilities and over time even giving them sentience. In only a few weeks the clockwork machines had evolved, gaining a new purpose in their existence. They came to call themselves the Automatons, and with the newly gained freedom of Dust they began learning…and advancing.
 
The Automaton civilization remained on their planet, learning to live in a symbiotic relationship with nature as the planet healed. They used the knowledge of their creators and their new Dust engines to produce massive floating ships on which they lived, thus protecting the recovering ecosystem on the planet. Over the course of centuries the planet healed and the Automatons learned to live with and love nature while developing advanced industrial capacity and production within the hulls of their floating ships -- which had also grown over time. Calculating that their Dust supply would run out and their civilization would die, the Automatons excavated the ruins of the Endless ship and began developing their own vehicles for space flight…</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomalyNoneTitle">-</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomalyNoneDescription">Uninhabited and lacking any notable anomaly (either positive or negative), this planetary body presents no unusual characteristics. Note: This can be a very good thing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly01Title">Garden of Eden</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly01Description">Lush and pleasant, with a single year-round season of pleasantly moderate temperatures, life is good on this planet. Everyone benefits from its natural wealth: Residents, tourists, businessmen, and scientists. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly02Title">Ancient Ruins</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly02Description">Search teams discover ruins of one of the many ancient civilizations that have risen and fallen since the birth of the universe. Trade, tourism, and research could potentially benefit from this rare find.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly03Title">Ancient Artifacts</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly03Description">Away teams, wearing red shirts to be easily found in the event of death, discovered numerous OOPArts -- Out Of Place Artifacts. Their origin and the identity of their makers is not known, but they will certainly be of value to researchers and of interest to tourists.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly04Title">Dust Ruins</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly04Description">Many ruins from the time of the Endless were Dust-enhanced structures or traditional buildings that preceded the Dust era. On very rare occasions, however, one can find entire structures built uniquely from this valuable resource.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly05Title">Coral Reefs</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly05Description">Picturesque, rich, and fascinating, these lush reefs beautify the planet, provide sources of food, and are of interest to tourists (once they have been declared either non-lethal or only partially lethal).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly06Title">Cyber Flora</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly06Description">A hybrid species that grew from Dust-infected lichen, this nearly indestructible plant can be found thriving even in the harshest conditions. Its beautiful, glossy sheen and interesting bio-technical properties create both a stunning environment and a source of scientific knowledge. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly07Title">Friendly Locals</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly07Description">Native inhabitants can be classified in one of two ways: those who view you as friends, and those who view you as dinner. Fortunately, this is the former case. By accelerating the colonists' adaptaton to the local ecosystem, they permit a higher density of population than is common on a planet of this size.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly08Title">Strange Fossils</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly08Description">What strange beasts were these! Science Officers have discovered the remains of long-dead creatures that appear exceptional in every way -- size, variety, eating habits, and number of limbs. Anthropologists and cosmologists are eager to study these finds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly09Title">Rich Soil</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly09Description">The soil of this planet is rich in bacteria and nutrients; crops will grow well and livestock will be healthy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly10Title">Mineral Rich</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly10Description">Due to its formation from dust clouds that spun off from the system's sun, the crust of this planet is unusually rich in minerals.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly11Title">Dust Lode</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly11Description">Once a base or battleground of the Endless civilization, their nanotechnological 'Dust' is omnipresent in the ground and atmosphere.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly12Title">Hadopelagic Life</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly12Description">Having deep oceans that are rich with life, this planet is abundant in hadopelagic creatures -- those that have adapted to the lightless environment at the bottom of the ocean and are tolerant of the tremendous pressures. They are not only a source of food, but provide useful scientific information on extremophilic life forms.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly13Title">Microfactories</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly13Description">Another innovation of the Endless, some Visited planets were sown with these Dust-built millimeter-scale factories that convert mineral solids into nutrient chains for crops. Adaptable or 'trainable' to a wide range of ecosystems, they are an enormous boon to food production and agricultural labor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly14Title">Antonov Rings</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly14Description">Dense rings of beige and brown asteroids with erratic orbits, the planetary rings are fascinating for tourists and equally interesting for scientific studies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly15Title">Huygens Rings</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly15Description">A rich, multi-colored band of asteroids surrounds this planet. Reflecting the star's light in green, gray, purple, white, and blue, they are a highly prized tourist destination as well as a ready source of minerals and alloys.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly16Title">Hollow Planet</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly16Description">About as anomalous as an anomaly can be, this planet has vast subterranean spaces that run hundreds of kilometers. Fascinating to tourists and scientists, it adds a great deal of habitable space that is highly defensible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly17Title">Mutated Flora</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly17Description">An example of biodiversity gone berserk, this planet shows a variety of plant mutations of every size, shape, color, scent, flavor, and psychoactive effect that one could imagine. Some of the more notable results include rich food supplies and ecstatic gourmet chefs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly18Title">Low Gravity</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly18Description">A lower density of planetary core effects many things, of which gravity is the most notable. This has advantages for industrial production and makes kids really, really happy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly19Title">Deserted Cities</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly19Description">An eerie reminder of yet another lost civilization, deserted cities are scattered across the surface of this planet. Even stranger, many of the buildings and machines are still in working order. If a planet had been conceived to make scientists and engineers happy, it is this one.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly20Title">Molten Springs</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly20Description">Blessed--or cursed--by volcanic activity close to the surface and a metal-rich crust, geysers of molten metal spew their very dangerous and very valuable contents from numerous points on the planet. Industry and commerce can clearly benefit from this bizarre geology.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly21Title">Rich Atmosphere</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly21Description">Rich in oxygen and other useful gases, the atmosphere of this planet is its main advantage. Food will be readily available, and native populations will be healthy and happy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly22Title">Ice 10</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly22Description">A rare form of ice that is caused by water crystallizing under high pressures, Ice 10 is interesting for its thermodynamic properties. Its extremely low temperatures, however, mean that the planet has a dangerous and hostile environment.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly22Reduction1Title">Ice 10 (-)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly22Reduction1Description">A rare form of ice that is caused by water crystallizing under high pressures, Ice 10 is interesting for its thermodynamic properties. A concerted effort by the planet's engineers has led to a lessening of its negative effects.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly23Title">Shattered Crust</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly23Description">The surface of this planet is a riot of cliffs, chasms, ridges, and spikes. While the broken surface means that many mineral resources can be easily mined, it also means that transport and construction will be challenging..</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly23Reduction1Title">Shattered Crust (-)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly23Reduction1Description">The surface of this planet is a riot of cliffs, chasms, ridges, and spikes. While the broken surface once meant that exploitation was difficult, a concerted effort by the planet's inhabitants has made this less problematic.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly24Title">Komatiite Volcano</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly24Description">Dude, where's my silica? These volcanoes of ultramafic rock from deep within the planet's mantle are sources of useful metal alloys, and can be cheaply exploited for geothermal energy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly25Title">Propitious Seasons</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly25Description">This is not merely a planet that has the benefit of an axial tilt that produces seasonal variations in weather; the seasons and their associated climates lend themselves well to agriculture.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly26Title">Permanent Monsoon</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly26Description">The good news: This is a water-rich planet and therefore of great value to agriculture. The bad news: This water is generally delivered horizontally in your face by gale-force winds. Tides and winds, fortunately, also provide ready sources of (wet) energy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly26Reduction1Title">Permanent Monsoon (-)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly26Reduction1Description">Once a very wet and very difficult environment, a concerted effort to partially terraform the planet has lessened the intensity of the winds and storms.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly27Title">Molten Core</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly27Description">Not all planets have a molten core, which provides some distinct advantages such as a natural magnetic field that shields the planet from cosmic rays and plate tectonics which contribute to evolution. For both these reasons, scientists find this type of planet particularly interesting.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly28Title">Metallic Waters</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly28Description">Rich in deposits of copper, iron, zinc, and other metals, the lakes and geysers of this planet are stunning to behold. The high metal content of the waters is also a boon to industrial development, as highly purified ores can be obtained through simple filtration.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly29Title">Robot Locals</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly29Description">Whatever civilization once thrived on this planet, all that remains are the rubble of buildings and a strangely helpful and obedient population of robots. Anthropologists may one day determine how and why they were created, but for now their main value is as a dedicated and uncomplaining workforce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly30Title">Aurora Waves</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly30Description">Gleaming, multi-colored auroras last all day and night, moving eerily across the surface of the planet. Though their properties are greatly appreciated by residents and tourists, the electromagnetic residue is a headache for scientists.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly30Reduction1Title">Aurora Waves (-)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly30Reduction1Description">The gleaming, multi-colored auroras that once caused such headaches have been partially tamed by magnetic shielding. Fortunately, their beauty remains even though their negative effects have been reduced.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly31Title">Metallic Ground</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly31Description">Almost dirt-free, the hard, gleaming surface of this planet makes agriculture difficult and potentially poisonous. The ease with which rare metals can be recovered, however, is a great advantage. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly31Reduction1Title">Metallic Ground (-)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly31Reduction1Description">Almost dirt-free, the hard, gleaming surface of this planet used to make agriculture difficult and potentially poisonous. Recent improvements in soil development, however, have eased the problem.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly32Title">Dense Atmosphere</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly32Description">Lava planets in particular, due to the continual combustion and high temperature of their crust, have atmospheres that are dense in organic compounds. Though it renders them a challenge to colonize, this anomaly also helps to increase the agricultural output.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly33Title">Psychoactive Air</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly33Description">With an atmosphere saturated by complex chemical compounds, life on this planet becomes interesting indeed if one does not breathe through a filter. Though the inevitable wandering thoughts make serious scientific research a bit difficult, it cannot be denied that everyone who lives here is really, really happy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly33Reduction1Title">Psychoactive Air (-)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly33Reduction1Description">With an atmosphere that was once saturated by complex chemical compounds, life on this planet was challenging. Application of terraforming technologies, however, has rendered the effects of the air less intense.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly34Title">Geothermic Activity</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly34Description">With lava rifts that pulse constantly and vast networks of minor volcanoes, two things are very clear about this planet: 1. Industry can be powered cheaply and efficiently; and 2. Inhabitants must watch where they step.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly34Reduction1Title">Geothermic Activity (-)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly34Reduction1Description">Applying enormous amounts of energy and grappling with gravitational alterations, the previously uncontrollable geothermic activity of the planet is now somewhat less intense.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly35Title">Hostile Fauna</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly35Description">While the beasts of this planet were first described as "giant," "primal," and "impressive," a more accurate description would have been "clever, silent, and ravenous." Though they are eagerly hunted and in fact are a good food source, few people enjoy living on a planet where the food pyramid is in fact a circle.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly35Reduction1Title">Hostile Fauna (-)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly35Reduction1Description">While the beasts of this planet were first described as "giant," "primal," and "impressive," these days the adjectives would tend to "controlled," "manageable," and "delicious."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly36Title">Swamp World</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly36Description">Described by explorers using adjectives like moist, damp, wet, aqueous, soft, lush, and well-hydrated, this planet offers abundant plant and animal life but will certainly be difficult to build upon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly36Reduction1Title">Swamp World (-)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly36Reduction1Description">Described by explorers using adjectives like moist, damp, wet, aqueous, soft, lush, and well-hydrated, newer travel guides to the galaxy now indicate that it is mostly harmless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly37Title">Seismic Activity</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly37Description">For those who like their rock and roll on a planetary level, this is the ideal home. Be warned, however, that though geo-physicists will adore it, it makes for nervous inhabitants and expensive construction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly37Reduction1Title">Seismic Activity (-)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly37Reduction1Description">By manipulating the magnetic core, stabilizing continental drift, and improving construction techniques, the problems in daily life caused by seismic activity have been notably reduced.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly38Title">Long Season</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly38Description">With an unusually long orbital ellipse, the planet has very long seasons and thus is exposed to extremes of cold in winter and heat in summer. While this is fascinating for scientific experiment, it is difficult for agriculture and makes everyday life stressful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly38Reduction1Title">Long Season (-)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly38Reduction1Description">While the long orbital ellipse remains a fact of life, the application of terraforming sciences, advanced architecture, and improved agriculture has changed it from a health risk into a quaint tourist adventure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly39Title">Meteor Strikes</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly39Description">While frequent and heavy meteor showers deliver precious metals for free, they also make life dangerous and require continual repairs to any exposed object. Radioactive and loaded with heavy isotopes, the meteors also wreak havoc with scientific research (and researchers).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly39Reduction1Title">Meteor Strikes (-)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly39Reduction1Description">For the first time in the history of the universe, the phrase "killer satellites" actually has a practical meaning. Thanks to cheap and robust sources of energy and heavily shielded orbitals, major meteor threats are neutralized high in the atmosphere.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly40Title">High Gravity</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly40Description">The unusually dense core of this planet gives it abnormally high gravity for its size. Architecture and industry must be adapted to deal with this. In addition, daily life is tiring and difficult.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly40Reduction2Title">High Gravity (--)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly40Reduction2Description">By the simple and straightforward process of bleeding excess gravitons across hyperdimensions into a parallel universe, the previously extreme gravity of the planet has been somewhat reduced.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly41Title">Poor Soil</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly41Description">Though not lacking in dirt, the planet is surprisingly low in the nutrients and microbes that turn it into a rich compound that stimulates organic life. As a result, agricultural prospects are worse than usual. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly41Reduction2Title">Poor Soil (--)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly41Reduction2Description">The soil of this planet, once sterile and barren, is now much richer in the organic life necessary for agriculture.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly42Title">Polar Tempests</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly42Description">Exceedingly cold winters and large continental masses drive this planet through cycles of violent weather. This results in heavy wear and tear on infrastructure, and makes farming--and life in general--unpleasant..</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly42Reduction2Title">Polar Tempests (--)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly42Reduction2Description">Controlled global warming, advanced thermo-efficient architecture, and really warm parkas have greatly lessened the negative effects of this anomaly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly43Title">Corrosive Soil</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly43Description">The content of this planet's soil is acidic and metallic. Not only is it difficult to grow food under these conditions, but the corrosive properties cause trouble for machines and electronics.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly43Reduction2Title">Corrosive Soil (--)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly43Reduction2Description">Thanks to technologies based on terraforming sciences, the once poisonous soil of this planet has been somewhat improved.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly44Title">Strong Magnetic Field</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly44Description">A large, liquid ferrous core gives this planet strong magnetic fields that fluctuate unpredictably. In order to counter this, much of the work done by industry and science has to undergo the expense of being carefully controlled and shielded.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly44Reduction2Title">Strong Magnetic Field (--)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly44Reduction2Description">Once directed non-baryonic magnetic flux technology was reduced to handheld size, the negative impacts of this anomaly were greatly reduced.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly45Title">Mineral Poor</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly45Description">Basically a big ball of silica and dirt, the planet's crust is abnormally poor in metals and minerals. Both life and industry struggle to adapt in this situation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly45Reduction2Title">Mineral Poor (--)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly45Reduction2Description">A number of major efforts, primarily terraforming and meteor harvesting, have reduced the problems caused by this anomaly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly46Title">Kessler Syndrome</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly46Description">An odd remnant of a past, lost civilization, the upper atmosphere of this planet is full of drifting debris. There is a cost to removing these remnants, and space-based experiments as well as satellites must be either expensively protected or often replaced.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly46Reduction2Title">Kessler Syndrome (--)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly46Reduction2Description">Though it took time, patience, and very large nets, much of the orbital debris that circulated the planet has been removed or dumped planetside for recycling.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly47Title">Toxic</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly47Description">Toxic elements in the atmosphere and the soil make this planet difficult to survive on. It is difficult to grow food except in protected laboratories, and the unpleasantness of daily life weighs on the inhabitants.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly47Reduction2Title">Toxic (--)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly47Reduction2Description">Dust-based micro-machining is in its infancy, but basic nano-factories using that technology have done much to convert the toxic chemicals into harmless organic compounds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly48Title">Acid Rain</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly48Description">Naturally occurring sulfur fumaroles cause highly acidic rain on this planet. This places heavy constraints on architecture and transport as well as creating a disagreeable atmosphere for the locals.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly48Reduction2Title">Acid Rain (--)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly48Reduction2Description">Partially by reducing the effects of the fumaroles and partially by hardening the infrastructure, many of the problems caused by this anomaly have been alleviated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly49Title">EM Radiation</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly49Description">Naturally high levels of Electro-Magnetic Radiation can cause havoc with an electronic or mechanical apparatus. Technology must be either shielded or frequently repaired, making both industry and daily life expensive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly49Reduction2Title">EM Radiation (--)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly49Reduction2Description">Thanks to the work of an under-appreciated genius, much of the excess EMR that caused trouble on this planet has been converted into children's toys.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly50Title">Irradiated</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly50Description">High levels of cosmic rays coupled with naturally occurring sources such as radon make this planet a dangerous place. There is a high risk of cancer-related diseases, and the radiation levels complicate scientific experimentation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly50Reduction2Title">Irradiated (--)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly50Reduction2Description">By developing and improving the ozone layer and atmosphere while better insulating construction, a large part of the dangerous effects of this radiation has been removed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly51Title">Hellgourds</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly51Description">An unfortunate side effect of Tan-Erbo's horticultural tampering, these large, carnivorous, orange plants will aggressively defend their territory. While they are potentially dangerous, they also have delicious fruit that can be used to make a wide variety of excellent candies. There are two risks when colonizing this planet, then; aggressive foliage and tooth decay.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly51Reduction1Title">Hellgourds (-)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly51Reduction1Description">Experiments with certain behavior-controlling luxury resources has produced an interesting side effect. When applied planet-wide, the compound nicknamed "Trikker Treats" has the effect of reducing aggressivity in both plant and animal species. As part of an anomaly reduction process, Hellgourds, while still territorial, can be rendered merely "annoying" instead of "murderous."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly52Title">Hostile Dust</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly52Description">The atmosphere shows unusually high traces of Dust, and that Dust shows a tendency to communicate and network to the detriment of your systems. While this does not prevent colonization of the planet, it will make industrial exploitation difficult until a permanent solution can be found.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly52Reduction1Title">Hostile Dust (-)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly52Reduction1Description">A brilliant young mathematician named Ial Adave has developed the Dust Manipulation Transformations, a series of algorithms that greatly improve the understanding of networking protocols and communication in Dust interactions. Using this, many of the "ripple" effects caused by hostile Dust interactions can now be dampened or suppressed altogether.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly53Title">Endless Trouble</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly53Description">You have apparently discovered a planet that was a battleground during the Dust Wars. As a result, it is a haven of unexploded ordinance, biological and technological viruses, and other unpleasant detritus. While it is habitable, it would best be colonized by citizens with nerves of steel and good reflexes.</LocalizationPair>

The planet could even be pleasant one day...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly54Title">Humeris Insidentes</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetAnomaly54Description">This planet was inhabited by a highly advanced race that died off when a massive volcanic eruption induced a prolonged winter. The knowledge of their civilization was meticulously documented and stored in bunkers scattered across the planet. Clearly, they expected to rise up after the winter and continue their evolution. Sadly, the bunkers sit unlocked and unused, and the people have returned to the dust. Their knowledge, however, is yours to explore.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetNaturalWonder01Title">#EAB643#Dust Nebula#REVERT#</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetNaturalWonder01Description">A warning beacon in the middle of an entire nebula rich with Dust tells its story. Due to poorly-controlled research, a strain of Dust ran wild and self-replicated out of control. By the time it was reined in, entire planetary systems had been converted to Dust, and no food remained for the handful of surviving researchers that left this grim note.</LocalizationPair>

While much of the technology is lost, the platforms still provide both living space and planetary defense.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetNaturalWonder03Title">#EAB643#The Glittering Halls#REVERT#</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetNaturalWonder03Description">The interior of this planet is riddled with cave systems, with some caverns large enough to house small cities. In addition, an excess of quartz formations means that natural light penetrates in some cases several kilometers below the surface. As a result, entire populations can be hidden underground, their industries powered by generous geothermal energy.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetNaturalWonder05Description">A natural anomaly whose probable existence is less than zero, this series of natural quantum-linked transport gates link the planets' surfaces with various points in the star system. Space-time is full of bridges, shortcuts, and holes, allowing rapid transport throughout the system.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetNaturalWonder06Title">#EAB643#The Rings of Urula#REVERT#</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetNaturalWonder06Description">These planetary rings remain in motion around a dead star that has been reduced to  a tiny black hole. The emanations of the black hole, combined with the metals and chemicals in the rings, have turned the entire anomaly into a sort of crucible. When ships pass through, they are aged and hardened. When heroes pass through, those that survive speak of ancient voices and lost knowledge.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetNaturalWonder07Title">#EAB643#Perpetual Flux#REVERT#</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetNaturalWonder07Description">Due to its location with respect to nearby stars, dark matter concentrations, metal veins, and planetary bodies, there is an enormous magnetic flux traversing the planet. The effect is powerful enough to drive "perpetual motion" machines, generating a free and inexhaustible supply of energy. It has also been harnessed to create levitation effects, greatly simplifying transport infrastructure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetNaturalWonder08Title">#EAB643#A-Entropic Field#REVERT#</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetNaturalWonder08Description">The Third Law of Thermodynamics states that increased disorder and decay is inevitable. This law is immutable and inevitable throughout all the worlds of all the galaxies. Except here. For whatever reason, entropy in the system increases at a measurably slower rate than anywhere else, meaning that it takes far longer for things to rust, weaken, and otherwise age.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood1Title">SUSTAINABLE FARMS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood1Description">Advances in soil biology have opened the gate to new, low-impact farming methods that reduce the need for water, fertilizer, and sunlight. In addition, crops will be able to grow in extremes of temperature and soil quality.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood2Title">EPIGENETIC CROP SEEDING</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood2Description">The ability to adapt plant DNA to its environment, and transfer those learned traits to successive generations, creates a boom in healthy, disease-resistant, long-lived crops.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood3Title">INTENSIVE CULTIVATION LOGISTICS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood3Description">Improving techniques in fertilizing, crop rotation, genetics, storage, and transport all lead to very efficient and high-volume food production.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood3SowerTitle">INORGANIC CULTIVATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood3SowerDescription">Artificial life forms, and biological forms "taught" to create useful additives, can provide efficient forms of production. They require enormous scale to be practical, however, and the most effective techniques include harnessing lunar gravity to maximize water cycles.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood3SwarmTitle">EXPLOITIVE AGRICULTURE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood3SwarmDescription">In order to maximize the output of agricultural land, irreplaceable groundwater, highly concentrated fertilizers, and genetically engineering seeds are used in great quantities. The damage to the land will be long-lasting, but food volumes increase notably.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood4Title">COMPACT REFRIGERATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood4Description">Mastery of increasingly miniaturized thermodynamics permits the creation of heat exchange systems small enough to fit into almost any item. Using these technologies, the risk of food spoiling is essentially reduced to zero.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood5Title">WASTELESS SUPPLY CHAIN</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood5Description">Technologies of transport and refrigeration tied to the monitoring of lifestyles and behavioral analytics all come together to ensure that the 30-40% of the food supply that is usually wasted or thrown out becomes available for consumption. An incredibly complex system, it nevertheless creates an enormous boost in food availability.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood6Title">PERMANENT PERENNIALS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementFood6Description">Crops are no longer recognizable as the plants from which they sprung. Nano-enhanced and genetically modified, healthy and immortal plants are food factories that run year-round, regardless of the weather. Continually harvested, self-fertilizing, and auto-regulating, the food supply will simply never run out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry1Title">HEAVY ISOTOPE REFINERIES</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry1Description">The development of n-way fusion technology permits the creation and exploitation of fuels that are stabler and cheaper, boosting industrial output.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry2Title">INTERPLANETARY TRANSPORT NETWORK</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry2Description">Due to the interaction of gravitational pulls and magnetic fluxes, low-energy paths exist that speed and simplify travel within a system. By also applying advanced magnetics to transport design, this low-cost network facilitates access to the farthest points of the system's limits.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry3Title">PREDICTIVE LOGISTICS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry3Description">Using advanced computational analysis, the flow of raw materials and manufactured goods can be optimized to an incredibly precise level. The ultimate execution of "just-in-time" commerce across an entire system is a powerful boon to industry.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry4Title">AI LABOR</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry4Description">Far more than the simple application of robotics, advanced computational methods and materials permit the creation of a highly flexible and instantly re-trainable workforce. Flawless, uncomplaining, and efficient, these workers boost both industrial production and R&amp;D.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry5Title">SELF-ORGANIZING CITIES</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry5Description">Trains change their schedules to arrive when needed. Over-crowded buildings grow extra floors. Windows adapt to maximize ambient light. Systems that handle air and waste scale up and down based on time of day, season, and long-term trends. With sufficiently advanced AI systems and self-aware materials, the self-organizing city is now a possibility.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry6Title">ADAPTIVE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementIndustry6Description">Now on a level with rudimentary Endless technology, the industrial base of the system has become intelligent, self-adapting, sustainable, and autonomous.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMoney1Title">XENOTOURISM AGENCIES</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMoney1Description">In order to properly tap into the exploding market of alien tourists, a special infrastructure must be put into place. Travel between planets is a simple problem; travel between cultures is something else indeed. In order to effectively provide an interesting destination for aliens, enormous work is required in public infrastructures, hotels, restaurants, spaceports, and--most particularly--toilets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMoney2Title">CAREFUL SWEEPING</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMoney2Description">This term for the tax system, an "in" joke between bureaucrats, indicates that the government is careful about picking up all the Dust it can, regardless of where it is (NP-hard math is required to plot the travel routes of the collectors).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMoney3Title">ABUNDANT LUXURIES</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMoney3Description">Trade and industrial systems are providing luxuries in such an efficient and inexpensive manner that the faction is now able to export, sell, and otherwise profit from a booming luxury trade. This has never before been possible, given previous constraints of scarcity and disposable income.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMoney4Title">ADAPTIVE TAXATION SYSTEMS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMoney4Description">Traditional taxation systems are often slow to change, and risk generating harmful economic behavior--like increasing savings when consumption is needed. Adaptive taxes, however, change instantaneously not only based on economic trends but according to product or service, and by location. As a result, ideal economic behavior is encouraged while government coffers are filled.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMoney4AmoebaTitle">ADAPTIVE TARIFFS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMoney4AmoebaDescription">A problem with traditional costing systems -- public or private -- is that they are slow to change. Adaptive tarification, however, applies a highly sophisticated series of psychological, educational, cultural, and political analyses to ensure maximization of investment. Taxes, pricing, import duties, R&amp;D bonuses, and all manner of financial stimuli can be integrated into a single, highly profitable model.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMoney5Title">AUTOMATED INVESTMENT INTELLIGENCE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMoney5Description">The application of advanced AI routines to individual and company decisions on cash usage are surprisingly powerful. By balancing factors as diverse as weather, raw material prices, real estate trends, and political trends, money can be spent in ways that generate a 'perfect' return on investment.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMoney6Title">REVENUE ZEN</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementMoney6Description">In the final analysis, the most valuable substance in the universe is Dust. Once the complexities of pan-galactic trade and finance are mastered, the final step in maximizing revenue and value is to exploit the fact that the currency of the known universe is alive and intelligent, and the line between a good or service and its payment is increasingly fluid. Once the fundamental nature of Dust's existence as both currency and good, theory and technology, is mastered, a state of Revenue Zen can be achieved.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience1Title">PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience1Description">Before any great scientific advances can be found, there must be money to do the research. By setting up a series of long-term agreements between public and private entities, future investments into large-scale, ambitious projects can be assured.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience2Title">MAGNETIC FIELD GENERATORS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience2Description">These create artificial magnetospheres around planets in order to compensate for the lack of a liquid ferrous core. They provide stable environments on planets that would otherwise be bombarded by radiation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience3Title">OPTICS RESEARCH LABS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience3Description">This is more than simply determining ways to collapse the wave functions of photons or study technologies to bend their paths. Fundamental research into the nature of leptons is part of the institutes' charter, and discoveries should have great effects on the knowledge of light, gravity, and dark energy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience3SophonTitle">ADVANCED OPTICS LABS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience3SophonDescription">This is more than simply determining ways to collapse the wave functions of photons or study technologies to bend their paths. Fundamental research into the nature of leptons is part of the institutes' charter, and these labs are expected to yield gravity-manipulating technologies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience4Title">GRAVITON-SHIELDED LABORATORIES</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience4Description">Thanks to the reactive capacities of etched graviton sensors, science develops the capacity to create shielding effects that isolate objects from the effect of gravity-bearing "graviton" particles. Critical space-oriented technologies can now be developed and tested anywhere. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience5Title">DARK SCIENCE INSTITUTES</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience5Description">Advances learned from deep space operations and the science of dark matter and dark energy generate important advances in science. Cutting-edge research centers that further this knowledge can provide a boost in technological development.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience6Title">ANOMALIES INSTITUTE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience6Description">Science has come to the point where anomalies can be recreated and studied under laboratory conditions, if those labs are built from highly resistant materials and systems. The anomalies unders study include black holes, entropy, stars, and dark matter.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience7Title">DEEP SPACE FACILITY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementScience7Description">Due to the low gravity vacuum that surrounds asteroids, they provide a perfect location for a center of research into the uses and effects of low gravitation. A side effect of this knowledge, of course, is the ability to use the technology and the asteroids themselves to improve system defense.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementTrade1Title">EXTREME OPTION EXCHANGE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementTrade1Description">Previously, option trading was a straightforward if technical calculation based on Black-Scholes and similar pricing models. However, with the inclusion of relativistic and non-relativistic frames these calculations become terrifically complex; any star system that can build the sophisticated computing and trading systems needed to deal in these options gains substantial benefits.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementTrade2Title">BORER'S GUILD BOURSE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementTrade2Description">This is an exchange where miners, gemologists, and other rock collectors come from all over the system to trade in their wares. It is under the management of a loose confederation of mining companies, known as the Borer's Guild.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementTrade3Title">SPACE ELEVATOR</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementTrade3Description">Part of a long-term investment program in infrastructure, the creation of space elevators across the system to transfer goods and people from planet to orbit is a resounding success. Without key materials and techniques adopted from other societies this would not have been possible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementTrade4Title">DUTY FREE SPACEPORTS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementTrade4Description">Whether it is a physical reaction or an emotional one, traversing a wormhole or using similar forms of transport tends to be overwhelming for travelers - whether tourism, business, or military. Strategic placement of a network of giant, duty-free spaceport 'starmalls' gives these ever-greater numbers of travelers a place to visit, relax, shop, meet, and blow off steam.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementTrade5Title">ALIEN COMMUNICATIONS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementTrade5Description">Always a barrier to trade, communication between disparate species renders negotiation slow and risky. By creating translators that understand language, body language, social norms, psychology, history, popular culture, customs, and tradition, trade agreements become rapid and painless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementTrade6Title">QUANTUM INFO EXCHANGE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementTrade6Description">The most valuable commodity in advanced society is information. Ultimately, the value of knowing when, where, and for how much to sell a good or service outweighs the value of the thing itself. With the development of exchanges that pass information at quantum-tunneled speeds, the myth of 'perfect knowledge' in economics has truly become a reality.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval1Title">INFINITE SUPERMARKETS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval1Description">With vastly improved methods for selecting, growing, and harvesting foods, it is possible to deliver any known dish or ingredient anywhere within a colonized world. Local markets have essentially become infinitely large.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval2Title">COLONIAL RIGHTS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval2Description">A complex question has always arisen around the power of a colonial government to administer its own affairs without too much interference from distant, once-important home worlds. Now that technology has rapidly developed to the point where colonies are autonomous, stable, and productive, most factions tend to adopt a 'hands-off' policy for laws and regulations -- in return for a constant supply of cash.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval2SowerTitle">ELEGANT NETWORKS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval2SowerDescription">Applying increasingly advanced algorithms to networks is a step towards a major goal of the Sowers: Effortless, simultaneous, bandwidth-efficient consensus. As all Sowers strive towards a common goal, they are greatly pleased at any possibility of effortless and unified decision-making that accelerates their progress.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval3Title">UNLIMITED INFORMATION HIGHWAYS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval3Description">Wars between content creators, infrastructure owners, end users, governments, and corporations sapped much of the value from the ability to network a society. By building open access to sources of research, entertainment, and news from around the universe, a boom in the use of information is paralleled by a boom in public opinion.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval4Title">CORPOREAL FREEDOM</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval4Description">Tradition, religion, and social mores tend to keep a tight rein on body evolution and the physical alteration of an individual's organism. However, for an enormous number of reasons (political, economic, and practical) governments tend more and more to let individuals freely change their physical structure through augmentations, grafts, clones, implantations, tattoos, electronic etchings, and other alterations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval5Title">PERMANENT VACATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementApproval5Description">What happens when society advances to the point where all basic needs are handled by automated and indestructible systems? Labor becomes an option, and the greatest challenge is the effective use of free time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementHabitat1Title">ENDOTHERMIC STRUCTURES</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementHabitat1Description">The creation of buildings that absorb various forms of passive energy (ambient heat, radiation, light, etc.) and convert it into usable energy creates a boom in inexpensive, temperature-indifferent housing. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementHabitat2Title">PSYCHOLOGICAL INSULATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementHabitat2Description">A great problem with increasing population can be the sudden increase in population density for beings that are not used to crowded habitats. Techniques of insulating individuals, family groups, and communities through a combination of architecture and urban psychology permits greater densities of population.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementHabitat3Title">LIVING HABITATS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementHabitat3Description">Advanced soil and plant biology results in the creation of living structures that self-heal, increase in size, and provide nourishment and waste recycling. Advanced shielding further allows these environments to exist in the most inhospitable environments.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementHabitat3HoratioTitle">STABLE HABITATS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementHabitat3HoratioDescription">Advanced soil and plant biology can potentially provide "living" structures that self-heal, increase in size, and provide nourishment and waste recycling. However, the addition of shared field technology to stabilize the atmosphere and insulate the populace from EM radiation gives these environments a higher level of security.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementHabitat4Title">SELF-REPLICATING HABITATS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementHabitat4Description">Thanks to intelligent materials evolved through the principles of inorganic evolution, inexpensive and automated habitats can be grown in any conditions by materials that 'learn' and adapt to their environment.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementColonyBaseTitle">COLONIAL BASE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemImprovementColonyBaseDescription">A few Quonset huts, a perimeter fence, supply depots, and a lot of brave adventurers -- the starting point of a colony looks the same, no matter what species does it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingSpecial1Title">PLANETARY INSTITUTE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingSpecial1Description">By using advanced manipulation of particles that allow for the laboratory recreation of atmospheric science, it is easy to do a detailed study of atmosphere and geology in order to take advantage of a planet's unique properties.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingSpecial2Title">HYDROSEQUENCING</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingSpecial2Description">The ability to track individual water molecules through the water cycle provides an instantaneous picture of absorption, evaporation, and precipitation across every planet. A gold mine of data is produced that improves agriculture, industrial usage, and private consumption of the galaxy's most precious resource.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingSpecial5Title">NON-BARYONIC SHELL</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingSpecial5Description">Increased understanding of unusual particles and gravitational interactions allows system-wide installation of protective fields that stabilize planetary infrastructures. By avoiding unwanted interference from non-baryonic radiation and particle surges, elements of risk and chance are removed from industrial processes. As a result, they become more reliable, predictable, and fruitful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingInformation1Title">CIS-OORT SATELLITES</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingInformation1Description">By constructing this net of satellites at great distance from a star (on the order of 40k to 50k AU's), a system's frontier is effectively extended due to improved signal reception (detection) and increased government broadcast range (influence).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingInformation2Title">COLLABORATOR NETWORKS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingInformation2Description">A joint collaboration between comm scientists and dissident recruiters, assets and systems are set up to provide information on hostile fleets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingInformation3Title">ENTANGLED SENSOR ARRAY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingInformation3Description">Untangling the mysteries of quantum entanglement leads to the unexpected capacity to sense the presence of incoming ships and fleets through lepton filtering.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingInformation3SophonTitle">PREDICTIVE SENSOR ARRAY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingInformation3SophonDescription">The application of imaginary math to real problems has provided an unexpected side benefit -- improved sensor efficiency. The inventor refuses to divulge details, murmuring only about negative, time-reversed tachyons.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingInformation4Title">SIGNAL LENSER ARRAY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SystemBuildingInformation4Description">A great advance in cloaking systems is made by particle lensing -- using magnetics and gravity, the motion of particles is controlled to conceal ships and installations. When coupled with advanced data analysis, it becomes increasingly difficult for enemy assets to analyze and understand signal patterns.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemConversionIndustryToDustTitle">IND-DUST CONVERSION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%StarSystemConversionIndustryToDustDescription">While industry and industrial research has its value, a decision is taken by the government to maximize Dust by turning all non-essential industry into financially negotiable instruments via a galaxy-wide hedge fund. These, in turn, will be traded for Dust on the polymarket, providing an enormous boost to empire income.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementFood1Title">EVOLVED SOILS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementFood1Description">Using lessons from hardy strains of bacteria and extremophilic eukaryotea, basic soil biology can be changed to improve nutrition and waste cycles. These changes will, however, propagate planet-wide over time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementFood2Title">ALIEN GRAFTING</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementFood2Description">A first step in creating hardy, sustainable (and non-toxic) local crops is to integrate known genomes and plant cycles into alien ecologies. Using advanced scanning and analysis known and alien plant types can be joined into relatively harmless produce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementFood3Title">HYPER-SCALE FARMS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementFood3Description">By dedicating increasing amounts of land to agricultural production, the planet is becoming an efficient and organized provider of food. Less land and money is available for other uses, however, as complex tasks of refrigeration, transport, storage, irrigation, fertilizer, and processing consume resources.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementIndustry1Title">INDUSTRIAL ZONES</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementIndustry1Description">Every new planet has its own specificities and challenges. Before great leaps can be made in exploiting a planet's resources, the first step is to adapt known and reliable industrial processes to the new environment. By overcoming challenges in transport, energy, and finance, a firm base for development can be created.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementIndustry2Title">GEO-INDUSTRIAL PLANTS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementIndustry2Description">These vast complexes serve a number of critical industrial functions: Production of geothermal energy; mining of planetary cores for specialized materials; advanced materials and geological research; advanced study of plate tectonics.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementIndustry3Title">3D REPLICATION PLANTS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementIndustry3Description">It was a large and complicated engineering task, but the creation of a planet-wide system of smart materials plus improved logistics has brought this world to the point where any industrial object can be 'printed' in a local factory. While the bonus to production is obvious, the complexity of the infrastructure becomes a dominant factor in the economy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementMoney1Title">COLONIAL EXCHANGE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementMoney1Description">Founding a colony is both complex and expensive. Using funds and technology from the government and investors, skills from the colonists, and raw materials from the planet, a system must be created to handle investments, loans, salaries, project finance... and taxes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementMoney2Title">ATEMPORAL FINANCE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementMoney2Description">The discovery of transport via faster-than-light travel and wormholes has added complexity to simple calculations of Net Present Value and rates of return. The development of Atemporal Finance is a new branch of finance, governing cases where space is a variable as important as time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementMoney3Title">FINANCE COMMISSION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementMoney3Description">In order to effectively execute trade and finance in a relativistic frame of reference, new regulatory systems and laws are required in order to control some of the new and unexpected effects of space-time on traditional investment structures. A major agency has been set up, and as it attracts financial institutions, lobbyists, economists, and speculators, it begins to have a major effect on the planet's development.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementScience1Title">EXOSCIENCE STATIONS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementScience1Description">Data is the lifeblood of science. As new planets are discovered, field scientists set up systems to measure and analyze the biology, geology, and meteorology of the planet and its atmosphere. Collecting, filtering and exploiting this information is a first and critical step.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementScience2Title">NONBARYONIC COLLIDER</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementScience2Description">Building a very large scale particle accelerator will permit the discovery of the existence and characteristics of WIMPs - Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. This will be critical for the understanding of dark matter, dark energy, and nonbaryonic particles in general.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementScience3Title">GLOBAL TECH PARK</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%PlanetaryImprovementScience3Description">A majority of the planet has been converted into an enormous research institute. Relatively non-polluting, high margin, and education-intensive, it draws companies and agencies to develop the next generation of galaxy-changing technologies. In addition, telepathics can be either augmented or diminished to improve group brainstorming or individual concentration. The cost of the infrastructure is high, however, and other industrial development is necessarily minimized.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToLavaTitle">LAVA TRANSFORMATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToLavaDescription">Through the use of effective (if clumsy) streams of gravitons, planetary cores can be liquefied and the basics of plate tectonics imposed on a planetoid. This effectively turns the planetary body into a seething cauldron that creates high-value minerals; it may somewhat reduce its value for tourism.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToBarrenTitle">BARREN TRANSFORMATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToBarrenDescription">A planet described as "barren" is generally devoid of air, water, and anything else that makes it habitable. Though this sounds unpleasant, there are worse places to live 'out there' and Barren planets also have their value.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToDesertTitle">DESERT TRANSFORMATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToDesertDescription">Though the climate may be hostile, a desert planet can be rich in valuable resources. "Upgrading" from an even less hospitable planet is still a major task, requiring the creation of atmosphere, some basic level of soils and hydration, and even simple life forms.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToArcticTitle">ARCTIC TRANSFORMATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToArcticDescription">While cold is amply available in the 0 Kelvin vacuum of space, the process of applying the correct amount of cold while hydrating a planet is not a simple operation. Atmospheric engineering and an advanced knowledge of water chemistry is needed to complete the process successfully.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToAridTitle">ARID TRANSFORMATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToAridDescription">Typically done to elevate a less hospitable planet type to Arid, this project requires the creation of viable soils and a functioning, if relatively dry, atmosphere. It is still an enormous investment in energy, raw materials, and time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToTundraTitle">TUNDRA TRANSFORMATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToTundraDescription">Terraforming a planet into a Tundra-type requires sophisticated manipulation of temperature and humidity on a planetary scale. This requires precise thermodynamic control and a great deal of energy, neither of which would be possible without the use of exotic matter.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToTerranTitle">TERRAN TRANSFORMATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToTerranDescription">Rich and varied, a Terran-class planet is one of the most viable and valuable planet types in the universe. Transforming another planet into this type is necessarily an expensive and scientifically complex task. But, like most things in life, it wouldn't be interesting if it were too easy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToOceanTitle">OCEAN TRANSFORMATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToOceanDescription">Water. An atom of oxygen bound to two simple hydrogens; something minimal and simple but necessary on the scale of a few trillion cubic kilometers to create an ocean world. While the result is a planet potentially wealthy in life and resources, it is not a project for the faint of heart.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToJungleTitle">JUNGLE TRANSFORMATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToJungleDescription">Changing any planet type into a world as rich and vibrant as a jungle requires time, dedication, and extremely sophisticated bioengineering. A masterpiece of applied genetics, artificial evolution, and resource utilization, this transformation is only available to the most advanced societies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToGasGiantTitle">GAS GIANT TRANSFORMATION </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TerraformationToGasGiantDescription">It required the combined capacities of three species to develop a reliable gas giant transformation process. Using Automaton terraforming systems, Deuyivan matter phase technology, and Endless gating science, a process has been developed to change the primary element of a gas giant, and even turn it into a telluric planet. That was quite complex, but the really clever part was figuring out how to reverse the process.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%AnomalyReduction1Title">SIMPLE ANOMALY REDUCTION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%AnomalyReduction1Description">There are a number of well-understood tasks that can be done to remove planetary anomalies. Filtering the atmosphere, removing poisons from soil, and stabilizing the magnetic field are all based on familiar, if expensive, processes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%AnomalyReduction2Title">EXTREME ANOMALY REDUCTION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%AnomalyReduction2Description">The removal or stabilization of more complex anomalies from a planet is a close kin to the sciences of terraforming. Like them, it requires enormous investments of time and money as well as highly advanced sciences if it is to be done within realistic terms.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ColonizeTerranTitle">COLONIZE TERRAN</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ColonizeTerranDescription">The greatest risk to colonizing Terran-type planets is taking their apparently 'friendly' ecosystems for granted. Rigorous scientific testing and analysis are required to study the atmosphere, food chains, proteins, and carbon and nitrogen cycles. In spite of their apparent compatibility, they can be full of rude surprises.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ColonizeJungleTitle">COLONIZE JUNGLE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ColonizeJungleDescription">As they teem with animal and plant life, jungle-type planets can be difficult to colonize. Medical supplies are critical to deal with the plethora of exotic fungi, bacteria, poisons, secretions, pollens, spores, and, of course, teeth and claws.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ColonizeOceanTitle">COLONIZE OCEAN</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%ColonizeOceanDescription">Generally rich in life and highly prized for colonization, ocean-type planets present two major problems: The first is developing a stable aquaculture infrastructure that provides all needed nutrients.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechE28ResistanceTitle">FACTORY MISSIONS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechE28ResistanceDescription">In a modern universe, the combination of the sacred and profane is commonplace. In developing colonies that are heavily oriented towards development and production, the Pilgrim nation is spreading both its message and its infrastructure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechE30Title">ENDLESS EMPIRE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechE30Description">By building a series of quantum-linked information centers, a faction is capable of maintaining constant, real-time data on -- more or less -- everything. In this unassailable position, no other empire can hope to achieve a greater mastery of technology, information, or Dust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechE31Title">DEUYIVAN CONSTRUCTION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechE31Description">Techniques learned from a recently discovered minor race permit the development of infrastructures in extremely high gravities.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT01Title">SOIL XENOBIOLOGY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT01Description">Studies of soil samples from other planets plus advances in understanding of extremophilic bacteria permit scientists to create, under certain conditions, hardier and more productive crops.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT02Title">XENOLOGY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT02Description">First contacts with alien beings cause a rapid development in disparate branches of study - linguistics, anthropology, biology, sociology. These are quickly brought together under the unifying title of "xenology."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT03Title">PARTICLE SCANNING</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT03Description">Early advances in systems that capture signatures from particles--be they matter or anti-matter--permit simple 'scanners' that poll space-time for any activity--even neutrino, photon and graviton. This information is used to find, identify, and track all objects that will enter or exit a planetary system.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT04Title">RELATIVISTIC ECONOMICS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT04Description">The effect of time dilation and space travel on traditional financial models is non-negligible. This new branch of economics provides a basis for defining investment and profit under non-Newtonian physics in non-Euclidean space-time, e.g. observed interest rates, human capital erosion, and NPV (Net Proto-Heisenberg Value).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT05Title">BOTANICAL SCANNING</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT05Description">Being relatively sedentary and slow-growing, plants are easier to scan and analyze than animals. Systems to tag and scan plant life on a large scale aid immeasurably in efforts to detoxify and colonize new planets an systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT06Title">IMPROVED FLEET MANAGEMENT</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT06Description">The complexities of managing a fleet are enormous, and more so when the problems of time, distance, and communication stretch across a galaxy. Systems of Command, Control, and Communications that move at the speed of thought are necessary, and would likely not be possible without a rudimentary understanding of Dust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT06ResistanceTitle">CONSENSUS SYSTEMS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT06ResistanceDescription">A particularity of the Pilgrims, many decisions are taken by a consensus of members. Expanding this human communication to their fleets and comm systems, technology has been developed to improve the sharing and analysis of data.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT07Title">RELATIVISTIC MARKETS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT07Description">The value of a good or service has traditionally depended on simple, two-dimensional models involving supply and demand. However, the ability to move through space-time in unusual ways requires re-thinking of traditional market structures and commodity pricing. Without these forms of advanced, 'hard' economic theory, interstellar trade remains a risky game of chance. With them, it remains a slightly less risky game of chance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT08Title">PLANETARY LANDSCAPING</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT08Description">In order to further control the environment and resources of a planet, landscaping can be done on a scale that is almost like re-terraforming. This permits far more intensive use of the surface for agriculture, development, or other purposes.

This permits far more intensive use of the surface for agriculture, development, or other purposes. There is a very real danger of over-exploitation, however, leading to an inevitable decline in food production.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT09Title">XENOMINEROLOGY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT09Description">It is not merely alien races, planets, and stars that are strange, it is the metals and minerals themselves that are discovered 'out there.' Xenominerology' is the study of the many forms of metal and mineral that can exist in the universe, their myriad properties and uses, and an understanding of their monetary value.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT10Title">NANOSCALE THERMODYNAMICS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT10Description">Thermodynamic systems are essentially simple circuits of absorption, transport, convection, and condensation. To do this on the level of atoms and molecules is something else, however. A capacity to create nano- and pico-scale units that heat and refrigerate is a game-changer. No pun intended.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT11Title">OPTIMIZED LOGISTICS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT11Description">Optimized logistics are a result of NP-hard solutions to organizational problems. Computational solutions to large-scale distribution networks, when extended into time-relative mathematics (and even with very high time complexity), have a surprising number of applications beyond simple demand management and load prediction.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT11SowerTitle">CONCURRENT LOGISTICS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT11SowerDescription">Optimized logistics are a result of NP-hard solutions to organizational problems.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT12Title">QUANTUM COMMUNICATIONS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT12Description">While the magic of neutrino communications and quantum tunneling did not turn out quite as expected, the exploitation of other aspects of relativity have permitted the creation of lag-less communications across space and time. While the math cannot be explained by less than forty-two Earth years of study, it has been proved that polarity-inverted time-reversed anti-messages are highly effective, with the loss of the occasional punctuation mark.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT12SwarmTitle">QUANTUM SWARMING</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT12SwarmDescription">Extending the principle of hive-style communication to advanced technology, quantum swarm algorithms imitate the shared pheromones and group communications of an insect swarm, but use the quantum properties of newly discovered minerals to propagate this across galactic distances.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT13Title">INTER-SPECIES HR</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT13Description">The famous saying of the Amoeba: "One being's slavery is another being's public welfare plan" certainly applies here.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT14Title">APPLIED HAPPINESS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT14Description">A number of different 'levers' exist to control the general level of contentment of a population--wealth, security, individual freedom, self-fulfillment, pharmaceutical intake, etc. With enough knowledge, computing power, and appropriately processed alkaloids, happiness is a state of being that can be imposed from without.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT15Title">ALIEN BARTER THEORY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT15Description">Many things influence the outcome of a negotiation--what the other wants, who influences them, how important it is, etc. Every alien race has different values, beliefs, and assumptions; studying these beforehand provides an enormous advantage.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT16Title">ADVANCED BIOLOGICS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT16Description">Biologics — drugs made through a biological process rather than chemical synthesis, a category that includes recombinant proteins, vaccines, and antibodies — are the fastest-growing segment of the pharmaceutical industry</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT16TerranTitle">CONSUMPTION PSYCHOLOGY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT16TerranDescription">The triggers of consumption are complex things -- from necessities and survival to style and taste.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT17Title">VOCATION-ORIENTED SOCIETY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT17Description">While many scholars agree that "self-fulfillment" is the ultimate goal of an individual, few have gone as far as to determine how to shape and direct a being's definition of that term. In a vocation-oriented society, all functioning members view a long and useful career of value creation for their company as the ultimate in self-fulfillment.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT17ResistanceTitle">ANALYTICAL FAITHBASE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT17ResistanceDescription">With an undeniably mystic side to their science, Pilgrim researchers develop systems to compare and contrast trends in faith. These trends are then compared to historical data, on-going projects, and observed anomalies. Information provided has been surprisingly useful for forecasting and negotiations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT18Title">ADVANCED SCHOLASTICS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT18Description">It has been proven innumerable times that the key to wealth and contentment is education. A highly advanced society, capable of educating all of its members to the degree that they are capable in the way that they desire, reaps enormous benefits.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT19SophonTitle">IMAGINARY GAME THEORY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT19SophonDescription">Game theory is already a sufficiently complex subject that deals with independent agents, choice, probability, and forecasting. Certain Sophon geniuses, dabbling in imaginary numbers, multiple dimensions, and time-reversed particles have created an alternative branch of this science. So far the results show stunning success and catastrophic failure in equal measure, but that's the fun of experimentation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT20Title">HIGH-CONSUMPTION SOCIETY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT20Description">For most of the pre-modern era, high consumption was equated with degradation, waste, and destruction. However, with element-level recycling systems and efficient waste management, the utopia of a constant churn of high-obsolescence products can finally be achieved.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT21Title">MAXIMIZED EXPLOITATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT21Description">Early industrial societies are more or less vast engines for producing waste; little of what is initially taken from the ground actually ends up as a product and the rest is dumped. By maximizing the processes of extraction, refining, transport, storage, and distribution, enormous gains in efficiency and volume can come with the added value of reduced waste.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT25Title">LONG-TERM XENO FUNDS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT25Description">While many cultures believe that "money makes the world go 'round", in fact the meaning of the phrase varies wildly if the numerous meanings of 'money', world' and 'go' are studied in depth. In fact, the process of investing for maximum return and value creation requires an understanding that combines the most advanced financial mathematics with psychology, xenology, cosmology, and being really, really lucky.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT26Title">DIRECTED AI COMPUTING</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT26Description">Academics came up with a mouthful of words for this simple concept: researchers partnering with an advanced AI to improve their chances of success.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT29Title">GALACTIC TRADE CENTER</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT29Description">Creation of a major financial center on any given planet is a major project -- alien habitats, highly advanced communication infrastructures, specialized universities, and the highest quality shopping and dining are among the pre-requisites. To do this on a level that could turn a solar system into a galactic center of finance is a very rare achievement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TechT29SwarmTitle">DISTRIBUTED HIVES</LocalizationPair>

When the pirates explained that they had sufficient numbers to obliterate him whether they attacked or defended, he simply shrugged. "Start the battle as you please. Either way, you're dead."</LocalizationPair>

A gritty, scarred warrior who stands out in a race of seekers and explorers, $Last uttered these famous words when a United Empire scouting party attempted to forcibly re-integrate $Last's 2,000-person habitat back into the empire.

He left the planet as soon as he could with the military, where he progressed through the ranks. Young and charismatic, $Last demonstrated an uncanny ability to assess a battlefield quickly and organize effective defenses. Over the course of the several years, his intervention saved many empire ships from destruction.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Hero61Description">Skuoi Kyryi was part of a small community that had created a large, complex infrastructure across a series of large asteroids. They learned of the Great Schism and the Dust Wars when an unmanned probe scattered hostile Dust across their habitat, dissolving the gangways and corridors. As the contents of the community were forcibly jettisoned into the vacuum of space, Skuoi, who had been outside repairing antennae and computer infrastructures, watched friends and family die.
 
Leading a small band of survivors he managed to isolate and counter-act the Dust invasion, though too late to save enough of the community to keep it viable. When the emergency mission that took them away finally reached a safe base, Skuoi was the only one who had not died of thirst.
 
A pitiless warrior and relentless adversary, the rage that burned within Skuoi did not die for decades. He became one of the most feared members of the Concrete defenses, though after numerous assassination attempts his body was eventually almost completely remade as an android.
 
Finally burned out and desiring peace and silence, rather than war and vengeance, Skuoi set himself adrift across the cosmos in cold stasis, living on memories. It is there that he was discovered; with his cause and his peoples long dead or gone, Skuoi is content to use his skills in the service of worthwhile allies.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Hero63Description">The Automatons take their role as caretakers so seriously, that certain horticulturalists gave their wards the capacity for self defense. Tan-Erbo went the farthest, developing a race of carnivorous and partially mobile giant orange plants that were set free to act as guardians of certain zones. However, the Automaton was unaware that these plants would assault anything foreign -- including Automatons. It was attacked during a routine inspection, and though it escaped the plants did manage to rip its head off. Fortunately, this did not result in decommission as its neural system had a wireless back-up. Tan-Erbo now travels with its head removed from its body, a solemn reminder of the risks of playing at god.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Hero64Description">Granddaughter of the famous Deona Kryv, the Pilgrim visionary who launched the first Fleet Errant, Jana lived forever in the shadow of her more famous predecessor. This happened  in spite of the fact that she was a genius and prodigy in xenotechnology and astrogation, receiving advanced doctorates in three related sciences by the age of 27. Driven to ever greater extremes and more amazing feats in order to make her own name famous, Jana disappeared into an unmapped stellar cluster after decoding an Endless navigational beacon. Lost and assumed dead, it was only when a strange quantum-tunneled signal emerged from that same cluster that the rest of the galaxy realized something was happening. Jana herself emerged shortly thereafter, somewhat dazed by the experience and rather surprised at what she had triggered.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Hero65Description">Rach was part of a pirate team that discovered an Endless research station -- on a supposedly empty asteroid -- whose systems had been awakened by Kryv's signal. Unfortunately the station's signature was picked up by a Sheredyn fleet that immediately moved in and took out Rach's ship. She hid in the Dust-infested station until an Amoeba mission picked her up; a fortunate event as the Amoebas tend to try pirates before executing them. Impressed by her intelligence and reason, Rach was freed and now sells her services across the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Hero66Description">Only known as Tephys, this hero was trained as an interrogator for the Sheredyn Military Police. An orphan and loner, for her the Sheredyn was the only sure thing in an untrustworthy universe. However, with the ascent of Emperor Zelevas and the sudden independence of the Sheredyn, Tephys's world destabilized. Turning assassin and infiltrator, she was captured by an unknown entity while trying to kidnap a Sophon scientist specializing in Endless technologies. Whatever happened that day, it caused her to leave the Sheredyn command structure and continue as an independent.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Hero67Description">Going by the name of his calling rather than his totally unpronounceable family name, Techseeker is part of a race of intelligent amphibian omnivores (Plocynos) inhabiting a swamp world, Codylus III. Driven by a fascination with mechanics and systems from a young age, contacts with space-faring species led Techseeker into an unexpected contact with an Endless artifact that crumbled to Dust as he inspected it. Surviving this exposure, he reveled in the power and insight that his Dust-enhanced powers gave him. Now a restless researcher of technology and industry, it should also be noted that he is very useful to have around during bar fights.</LocalizationPair>

With the ship apparently destroyed by an ancient defensive ring of Dust mines that had been reanimated by Kryv's act, only Bor -- who has yet to remove his or her suit, for unknown reasons -- survived. While generally silent and dour, slow to speak and quite serious, Bor seems lively and more energetic in groups, gaining energy from others.</LocalizationPair>

Generally hated for his management style if respected for his wealth, over a 24-hour period $Last underwent a stunning, 180-degree personality change. Rumors based on hearsay refer to Dust-induced hallucinations pertaining to historical occurrences, present day operations, and probability distributions of future events. Regardless of the reason, $Last left his job as head of accounting at the Polaris Workshop and now travels the galaxy, still famed for his management but also for his generosity.</LocalizationPair>

Now a pirate and freelance troublemaker, she is extremely wealthy and a constant source of trouble for the UEH. Though she seems to be in it for the money, in fact Carter harbors notions of building a fleet strong enough to give the Empire what it deserves.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomacyTheirAnswerTitle">THEIR REACTION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomacyTheirAnswerDescription">The answer given by the other empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendWorsening">Though your recent actions are of some concern, we feel obligated to try to restore harmony to our worlds.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendStable">War is such a difficult way to find solutions to common problems. Are you willing to discuss alternatives?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendImproving">When improvements occur between entities that are engaged in hostilities, one always hopes that peace and harmony might win out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendWorsening">Ah, to be in such an agreement with a trusted nation of like-minded souls! Sadly that is not the case, but we would try to make it so.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendStable">A proposal of cooperation is always welcome in a dangerous galaxy, is it not? Please give this proper consideration.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendImproving">It is unfortunate that not all leaders share your openness and wisdom. Would greater co-operation be possible?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendWorsening">In spite of your tendency to rash and unharmonious behavior, we feel the galaxy would benefit from a closer relationship.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendStable">We of the Amoeba understand the opportunities and complexities of alliances. Would you be prepared to face such challenges with us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendImproving">Please understand that this type of proposal is not made lightly! In your behavior we see hopes for true galactic unity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendWorsening">With heavy hearts, we notify you that your actions have forced this situation upon us. Would that it were not so!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendStable">War means death, waste, pollution, and a loss of harmony and unity. Though the Amoeba abhor it, we fear it is necessary.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendImproving">Is this the only solution to our current situation? The Amoeba hope for something a bit more positive, but see no other course of action.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendWorsening">Though some minds counsel that this seems to be against our interests, we nevertheless invite you to join with us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendStable">Have you noted the existence of our joyous federation of friends? We were wondering if you are fated to become part of it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendImproving">It is hard work, to maintain such a union of like-minded souls. We ask you to share the burden of its continued success.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendWorsening">There is some discomfort with your place within this alliance. Perhaps we should have reflect upon our mutual concerns earlier.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendStable">In many relationships, the time comes when one must accept the possibility of failure, even in an association as fruitful as ours.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendImproving">Our humble request may be unexpected, but there remains some dissatisfaction with your role in our alliance. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendWorsening">Ah, peace! Such a worthy goal; such an important step to greater things. And, in spite of your activities, we extend it as an offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendStable">As things stand, the creation of a lasting peace between us is certainly worth consideration. Peace is, after all, a harbinger of greater things.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendImproving">The Amoeba cherish the ideals of peace and harmony most deeply; we can only hope that improving relations convince you of the same.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendWorsening">While our hopes lead us to desiring this opportunity, recent decisions on your part indicate that you may not feel the same.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendStable">This concept appeals to our love of integration and harmony, though reserve must be taken that we do not expose ourselves unduly.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendImproving">To freely mix and mingle, sharing wisdom and ideas, communing across the bounds of space and culture… Does this also appeal to your worthy citizens?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendWorsening">Often, when proposals are made without an existing understanding, their goal is purely avaricious.  We assure you that is not our situation, regardless of your impunity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendStable">Trade is not, in and of itself, an end; it is but a means to a deeper understanding between cultures. Are you prepared to join us in this?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendImproving"> As relations between us improve, every little act -- even if it is purely economic -- can only be seen as a step towards a greater communion. Do you agree?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendWorsening">Good will should be improving, not declining, for the Automaton to trust others. However, redemption is possible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendStable">The Automaton ask whether such a step is possible in the light of current situations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendImproving">The Automaton sees no risk to its duties from this proposal; do others feel the same?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendWorsening">To co-operate with the Automaton, one should show less scorn for the Automaton. Here is a chance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendStable">Of the many things that could realistically happen, is this one desirable? Much good can come of mutual efforts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendImproving">Indications are that co-operation could benefit the Automaton as well as other entities.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendWorsening">The Automaton sees difficulty in an alliance where there is no trust or empathy. But to try is concordant with our duties.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendStable">This puts the Automaton's fate in others' hands. It must be considered carefully.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendImproving">The Automaton seldom sees value in this situation. Yet with trustworthy entities it is generally aids our duties.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendWorsening">The Automaton is not surprised that others' actions have driven us to this deplorable state. The Automaton will not concede.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendStable">The Automaton is not defenseless, nor inactive. Threats to our duty and efforts cannot be tolerated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendImproving">The Automaton apologizes. Relations appear to trend positively, yet conflict is inevitable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendWorsening">The Automaton offers this with reservation, as there is a situation of declining trust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendStable">The Automaton values autonomy, as do other entities. However, this proposal has merits.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendImproving">The Automaton sees value in mutual efforts with trusted entities. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendWorsening">The Automaton is used to being alone and independent. Others' actions require that we reinstate this condition.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendStable">The Automaton understands that sometimes things occur. This is simply a thing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendImproving">The Automaton realizes that this proposal was not expected, given current trends in relationships.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendWorsening">The Automaton seldom makes peace with entities who cannot be trusted. This is an exception.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendStable">Fixing a peace agreement is not a simple matter. The Automaton deliberated long before making this offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendImproving">Peace is preferable to war. Creation is greater than destruction. Trends indicate that other entities agree.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendWorsening">The Automaton borders usually remain closed to those who cannot be trusted. Yet we offer, in spite of the risk.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendStable">The proposal could cause vulnerabilities. The Automaton has discussed it, and feels it is nevertheless appropriate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendImproving">The Automaton usually closes its borders. But this proposal is for a trusted entity, and the Automaton sees little risk.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendWorsening">The Automaton will not become reliant on unreliable entities, so this proposal is unusual.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendStable">The Automaton sees benefit in mutual enrichment.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermAutomatonAttitudeTrendImproving">The Automaton does not see unexpected risk in this proposal, given positive trends in others' actions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermSwarmAttitudeTrendWorsening">You have one chance. This is it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermSwarmAttitudeTrendStable">It serves the hive. Accept, or the hive serves you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermSwarmAttitudeTrendImproving">For cannon fodder, you are not without merit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermSwarmAttitudeTrendWorsening">Cooperate. This is not necessarily an offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermSwarmAttitudeTrendStable">The hive seldom cooperates with its food. This is an exception.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermSwarmAttitudeTrendImproving">This is a rare offer. The hive views you as more than just a source of nutrition.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermSwarmAttitudeTrendWorsening">Though your death is preferable, an alliance is possible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermSwarmAttitudeTrendStable">We extend the offer to eat, uh, *rule* your citizens.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermSwarmAttitudeTrendImproving">The hive rarely makes alliances, but is willing to make this exception.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermSwarmAttitudeTrendWorsening">The hive looks forward to this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermSwarmAttitudeTrendStable">Shall we?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermSwarmAttitudeTrendImproving">This is a fortunate necessity. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermSwarmAttitudeTrendWorsening">Though you are offensive, an alliance may be useful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermSwarmAttitudeTrendStable">This is an offer that seems reasonable. Not wonderful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermSwarmAttitudeTrendImproving">It is rare for the hive to view others as anything but a light snack.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermSwarmAttitudeTrendWorsening">No, this is not a polite request.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermSwarmAttitudeTrendStable">An alliance no longer appears to be of value to the hive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermSwarmAttitudeTrendImproving">It is unfortunate. It is also necessary. Goodbye.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermSwarmAttitudeTrendWorsening">It hurts us to do this, but we offer you peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermSwarmAttitudeTrendStable">Take it or leave it. We are indifferent.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermSwarmAttitudeTrendImproving">We are surprised that we are doing this. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermSwarmAttitudeTrendWorsening">You are unpleasant, but the offer is genuine.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermSwarmAttitudeTrendStable">Please open your borders to our fleets. Did we phrase that badly?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermSwarmAttitudeTrendImproving">The hive sees many advantages to this. Which is unusual.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermSwarmAttitudeTrendWorsening">The hive is forced to stoop to petty commerce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermSwarmAttitudeTrendStable">Exchange for mutual benefit. What a strange concept.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermSwarmAttitudeTrendImproving">Given your trustworthiness, the hive is prepared to trade.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermHisshoAttitudeTrendWorsening">Though there is no glory in 'Cease Fire', it is offered in spite of your temerity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermHisshoAttitudeTrendStable">To the Hissho, it is better to fire than to cease. But still, the offer is made.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermHisshoAttitudeTrendImproving">It is possible, if not preferable, to cease hostilities with a worthy foe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermHisshoAttitudeTrendWorsening">Co-operation is for friends and allies. You appear to be neither, but the offer is made.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermHisshoAttitudeTrendStable">Co-operation could be to both of our benefit. This is not a question of honor, but pragmatism.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermHisshoAttitudeTrendImproving">This will not bring glory, but perhaps some profit. Does your emperor find that interesting?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermHisshoAttitudeTrendWorsening">There is seldom good reason to ally with those who lack honor. However, conditions require the Hissho offer this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermHisshoAttitudeTrendStable">The greater the force, the greater the potential victory. Is your emperor prepared to join us?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermHisshoAttitudeTrendImproving">Together, we can create such a history that the stars will sing our praises. Let us celebrate this day!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermHisshoAttitudeTrendWorsening">All actions have consequences. In this case, yours may cause the end of you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermHisshoAttitudeTrendStable">War is not an evil thing; it is a way we may measure our greatness.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermHisshoAttitudeTrendImproving">This offer of honorable conflict may be unexpected. But with an honorable enemy, it is welcome.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermHisshoAttitudeTrendWorsening">It is difficult to enter into an alliance with those who are viewed with contempt. However, in this case it is necessary.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermHisshoAttitudeTrendStable">The thought of a more powerful union is appealing, no? The greater the force, the greater the enemies, the greater the glory to be had.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermHisshoAttitudeTrendImproving">An interesting challenge, no? Together we can find greater conquests to bring glory to this great alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermHisshoAttitudeTrendWorsening">There is no shame for you to leave this alliance. And for us, honor demands you depart.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermHisshoAttitudeTrendStable">What is today is an amicable separation may tomorrow be war. Let us hope that this is so.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermHisshoAttitudeTrendImproving">The hopes for greater honor have not yet waned; the Hissho prefer to continue their battles without you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermHisshoAttitudeTrendWorsening">Our citizens are angry that we offer peace to you; they would prefer your deaths. Think carefully on this offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermHisshoAttitudeTrendStable">Peace cannot come without trust, and never at the price of honor. The Hissho are prepared to offer it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermHisshoAttitudeTrendImproving">An honorable end to a righteous struggle will not bring disgrace to our people.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermHisshoAttitudeTrendWorsening">The opening of our borders is an embarrassment, given your behavior. We hope the results justify it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermHisshoAttitudeTrendStable">A decision this important required a sacrifice and much discussion. The Hissho honor you by offering it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermHisshoAttitudeTrendImproving">The Hissho see worthy allies in your people; we hope better relations confirm this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermHisshoAttitudeTrendWorsening">Though your people do not seem worthy of it, we make this offer to you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermHisshoAttitudeTrendStable">There are practical reasons to trade, when greater glory is not possible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermHisshoAttitudeTrendImproving">Your integrity indicate an honorable people; our proposal salutes this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermHoratioAttitudeTrendWorsening">Horatio does not like you, but we would like the noise to stop.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermHoratioAttitudeTrendStable">Shall we cease hostilities? Or maybe have some tea. Decisions, decisions…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermHoratioAttitudeTrendImproving">Strange. A cease fire with you almost feels like a good idea.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermHoratioAttitudeTrendWorsening">We offer this treaty of co-operation, though it is painful to do so with such louts.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermHoratioAttitudeTrendStable">I suppose we could co-operate. A bit. On some things. What do you think?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermHoratioAttitudeTrendImproving">There's so many things we could co-operate on. Wine, fashion, jewelry, perfumes…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermHoratioAttitudeTrendWorsening">The thought of you sniffing around our planets makes us vaguely queasy. But I suppose it might be worthwhile.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermHoratioAttitudeTrendStable">We could ally. Not a great idea, not an awful idea. It just sort of came to us. What do you think?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermHoratioAttitudeTrendImproving">We are prepared to honor you with an alliance. Try not to scream for joy, our ears are sensitive. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermHoratioAttitudeTrendWorsening">Don't think of it as war. Think of it as divine punishment for your lack of refinement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermHoratioAttitudeTrendStable">It's not that you're particularly brutish toads. It's just that war seems like a good idea.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermHoratioAttitudeTrendImproving">Isn't that sweet? We don't just declare war on anybody. They have to be really special.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermHoratioAttitudeTrendWorsening">If my advisors weren't so pushy, there is no way I'd offer an alliance to anyone as tacky as you are.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermHoratioAttitudeTrendStable">Well, I suppose it's not a bad idea to form an alliance. And it gives me a good reason to order people around some more.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermHoratioAttitudeTrendImproving">Oh, my. Who wouldn't want an alliance with people as charming as you are. A bit of the bubbly to celebrate?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermHoratioAttitudeTrendWorsening">Out, out, out. You're beginning to stink up the place.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermHoratioAttitudeTrendStable">Don't see it as rejection. Pretend I just changed the status of our relationship to "it's complicated".</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermHoratioAttitudeTrendImproving">It really is sad to see you go. But the party's over, and now we have to clean things up. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermHoratioAttitudeTrendWorsening">It's not that peace is such a great idea. And certainly not with you. But sadly, it's probably the smart thing to do.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermHoratioAttitudeTrendStable">I know, peace is so booooring. No songs, no excitement, no explosions. We just feel like offering it today.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermHoratioAttitudeTrendImproving">Do accept the offer. Stop by, have a chat, offer us gifts. Peace can really be diverting, you know.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermHoratioAttitudeTrendWorsening">I like you less and less. This is sort of a last-ditch offer to see if we can work things out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermHoratioAttitudeTrendStable">So tell me what you think. It could be fun. Or not. I'm feeling sort of ambivalent about the whole thing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermHoratioAttitudeTrendImproving">Oh, you ought to say yes. "Open borders" is like "open house". A big party, and everyone's invited!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermHoratioAttitudeTrendWorsening">Enough already. If you want to trade, then trade. But you're no longer my favorite enemy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermHoratioAttitudeTrendStable">You have some nice things. I have some nice things. We could trade them. Doesn't that make you feel special?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermHoratioAttitudeTrendImproving">I just know you're going to love this! And if you don't, you're wrong, so get over it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermResistanceAttitudeTrendWorsening">This doesn't mean we trust you. It only means that the Delegates have asked for a cease fire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermResistanceAttitudeTrendStable">War is tiring, risky, and distracting. I think we've had enough of it for now.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermResistanceAttitudeTrendImproving">I'm not convinced being at war with you is in anyone's best interest. Perhaps we were wrong about you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermResistanceAttitudeTrendWorsening">I'm not convinced it's a good idea, but I'm offering to co-operate with you anyway.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermResistanceAttitudeTrendStable">Let's try this out. It may work, it may not.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermResistanceAttitudeTrendImproving">Things are getting better and prospects are looking up. I say we move ahead together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermResistanceAttitudeTrendWorsening">It's against my better judgment. But Delegates that I trust say we should co-operate more closely, so I'll make the proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermResistanceAttitudeTrendStable">An alliance could be in both our interests. Maybe we should try it out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermResistanceAttitudeTrendImproving">As we move ahead in our mission to discover the Endless, we'd like to have you as an ally. That's how much we trust you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermResistanceAttitudeTrendWorsening">It's getting worse, and there's no end in sight. We're going to have to clear the air the hard way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermResistanceAttitudeTrendStable">Nobody likes it when it works out his way, but sometimes it just does. Endless preserve us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermResistanceAttitudeTrendImproving">It's too bad we have to do this, seeing how things were going. But I'm out of options right now, and this is what the Delegates want.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermResistanceAttitudeTrendWorsening">I don't like how things are going -- relations have started to slip. But maybe if you join up, we can fix that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermResistanceAttitudeTrendStable">It's not clear, but there may be some advantages in bringing you into the fold. What do you say?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermResistanceAttitudeTrendImproving">We like what we see and I like how things are going. What do you say you join our alliance?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermResistanceAttitudeTrendWorsening">It couldn't last. Things are going bad between us, and I don't want to risk the alliance on that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermResistanceAttitudeTrendStable">It was a hard decision, but in the end I'm thinking it's better if you go. Endless preserve you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermResistanceAttitudeTrendImproving">I'm sorry to shock you like this, but after discussion with the Delegates we're afraid we have to ask you to go.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermResistanceAttitudeTrendWorsening">I'm not sure you're the type of people to offer peace to, but we generally find it's preferable to war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermResistanceAttitudeTrendStable">All in all, peace seems like a good idea. What do you think?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermResistanceAttitudeTrendImproving">The logical next step is peace, and the Delegates agree that you're a people we can trust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermResistanceAttitudeTrendWorsening">We're ready to open our borders up in spite of your recent actions. Endless watch over us all…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermResistanceAttitudeTrendStable">If you tally up both sides, it comes out about even. I say we go ahead and risk open borders. You?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermResistanceAttitudeTrendImproving">It's an act of trust, and of hope. We're willing to open our borders if you'll do the same. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermResistanceAttitudeTrendWorsening">We don't like how things have been evolving lately. But the Delegates still want to offer you this deal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermResistanceAttitudeTrendStable">It's dark and solitary out here. A mutual exchange might be a good way to make life a little easier.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermResistanceAttitudeTrendImproving">You're a trustworthy people, and we don't mind doing business with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermEmperorAttitudeTrendWorsening">The Chiefs don't like it, but I'll offer it anyway.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermEmperorAttitudeTrendStable">Maybe we've done enough mutual damage. What do you say?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermEmperorAttitudeTrendImproving">We shouldn't be at each other's throats.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermEmperorAttitudeTrendWorsening">I'm not sure I trust you. View this as "co-operation, or else…"</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermEmperorAttitudeTrendStable">I'm sure we could find something mutually beneficial. There's a lot of galaxy out there.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermEmperorAttitudeTrendImproving">We have some solid ties between our two groups. Don't see why we shouldn't co-operate more closely.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendWorsening">If the Chiefs didn't tell me to do this, I wouldn't consider it. You got something to prove to me.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendStable">I think we could make this work. And I think we'd work out better as allies than not.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendImproving">I won't pretend. We get along well with you guys, and an alliance could only help us both.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermEmperorAttitudeTrendWorsening">I'm hoping you didn't expect flowers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermEmperorAttitudeTrendStable">Sometimes it happens. That's just how life is.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermEmperorAttitudeTrendImproving">I'd rather not have to do it this way. But sometimes there's no choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendWorsening">You got something to prove here, understood? But I'll take a chance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendStable">We could use some more good people here.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendImproving">The Legion and the alliance would both be glad to see you join. How about it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendWorsening">Enough is enough. You're out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendStable">No hard feelings. It's just what the Legion wants.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendImproving">It looks like it isn't working out. One of us has to go, and it won't be the Legion.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendWorsening">I got a bad feeling here. But a peace treaty still might make sense.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendStable">Could be a good idea. We figure we might as well try it out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendImproving">Listen to me. A peace treaty is the right things to do.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermEmperorAttitudeTrendWorsening">Okay, we'll try open borders. But the Legion isn't convinced you're pure as the snow on this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermEmperorAttitudeTrendStable">Mutual benefit. Simplify travel and trade. Me and the Chiefs say it makes sense. You?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermEmperorAttitudeTrendImproving">This here's a no-brainer. We trust each other, and it's gonna make our lives easier.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermEmperorAttitudeTrendWorsening">Take it or leave it. I'm not a big fan of yours right now.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermEmperorAttitudeTrendStable">I'm guessing it makes sense. We could do a deal, both walk away happy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermEmperorAttitudeTrendImproving">We'd be happy to trade with you guys. Let's see what we can work out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermSophonAttitudeTrendWorsening">Okay, I'm offering a cease fire. No, I don't like it, but I got out-voted.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermSophonAttitudeTrendStable">We might as well do a cease fire, right? Lots of other things to do in life besides shoot at each other.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermSophonAttitudeTrendImproving">C'mon, stop it already. There's only so many useful resources we can blow up before we all look stupid.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermSophonAttitudeTrendWorsening">Personally, I think "co-operate" has too many syllables for you to understand. But they still want to propose it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermSophonAttitudeTrendStable">What do you say? We work together, we both get something. You get brains, we get… hmmm…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermSophonAttitudeTrendImproving">C'mon c'mon it's a great idea. At least it is for you, and two of the three of us think it's good for us. Yeah, the other two.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermSophonAttitudeTrendWorsening">I feel like an idiot proposing this, the way you've been acting. I'm really hoping there'll be some long-term benefits.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermSophonAttitudeTrendStable">This is a good idea. Obviously, because we said so. Look, we're smart. Trust us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermSophonAttitudeTrendImproving">Seriously this could be great. Think about it! Sophon science, Sophon technology, Sophon tourists…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermSophonAttitudeTrendWorsening">War is really stupid. But you are so much stupider that we don't really have a choice.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermSophonAttitudeTrendStable">Yeah, yeah. I know it's usually a bad idea. But this is how the numbers worked out, okay?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermSophonAttitudeTrendImproving">This is a lousy idea. You were finally starting to shape up! But too little, too late…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermSophonAttitudeTrendWorsening">Outvoted again. And I annoyed them so much that they told me I had to make the offer. So here it is. Interested?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermSophonAttitudeTrendStable">It could be smart to join our alliance. We won't know until we try it, but all the forecasts look pretty good.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermSophonAttitudeTrendImproving">Come on, join the alliance. It must be a good idea, because it came from the Sophons. Those are the only ideas we have.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermSophonAttitudeTrendWorsening">Yes! Out! Go! You have no idea how good it feels to say that, seeing the way you have been acting.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermSophonAttitudeTrendStable">The math works out pretty balanced. But I figure it's a better idea if you leave. Sorry.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermSophonAttitudeTrendImproving">You were doing better. Much better. But a Sophon's gotta do what a Sophon's gotta do. You're out!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermSophonAttitudeTrendWorsening">Oooooh, they made me do this. I really don't like peace treaties with people who annoy me.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermSophonAttitudeTrendStable">It's probably to our mutual benefit. And we calculated 'probably' to 30-plus decimal points.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermSophonAttitudeTrendImproving">C'mon, let's go. Make peace and shake hands, so then we can go do dangerous science together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermSophonAttitudeTrendWorsening">I'd rather keep them closed, seeing the way you have been acting. But statisticians say it's a good idea, and we like a well-crafted equation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermSophonAttitudeTrendStable">If we offer this, there's a pretty good chance it's to our benefit. No, we didn't calculate your benefit. Geez, show up for work!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermSophonAttitudeTrendImproving">What a great idea. I mean I've had great ideas before -- tons of them -- but this one is really great. Just sign here, okay?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermSophonAttitudeTrendWorsening">Okay, you can have some stuff. I hear primitives like you really like things that are shiny.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermSophonAttitudeTrendStable">What do you say to a couple of deals, a little trade? Pretty good idea, right?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOtherTermSophonAttitudeTrendImproving">Oh, this is a good one. We both get what we want, and more important, I get what I want. Perfect!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCeaseFireTermTerranAttitudeTrendImproving">Given our improving relations, the Empire feels a cease fire would be of mutual benefit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermTerranAttitudeTrendWorsening">Perhaps you are not taking our offers and our good will seriously. However, we are willing to write up a co-operation treaty in the hopes of improving our relations.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCooperationAgreementTermTerranAttitudeTrendStable">As our recent affairs have maintained a status quo, we feel it is time to move things along and are ready to propose a co-operation treaty.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermTerranAttitudeTrendWorsening">The tone of your recent communications appears dismissive, if not rude. In order to turn around the situation, we feel that an alliance could be in order.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermTerranAttitudeTrendStable">Seeing little change in our relations, the Empire feels that an alliance would be an excellent way to profitably move our affairs forward.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingCreateAllianceTermTerranAttitudeTrendImproving">The galaxy is large and full of resources. We feel that a mutual alliance with an excellent partner such as yourself would be the ideal way to exploit it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermTerranAttitudeTrendWorsening">Enough is enough. Your continued refusal to act diplomatically or even rationally has forced us to declare war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermTerranAttitudeTrendStable">Though there is little ill will between us, we feel that the galaxy can not be secure for the Empire with the current balance of power.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingDeclareWarTermTerranAttitudeTrendImproving">While hope remained, given the relatively positive relations we share, the Empire is driven for numerous reasons to declare war.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermTerranAttitudeTrendWorsening">We hope to pull our relations out of the current downward spiral. Perhaps an alliance will prove profitable for us both.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermTerranAttitudeTrendStable">Given our common interests in the exploitation of the galaxy, we feel that an alliance between our empires could be mutually advantageous.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingInviteToAllianceTermTerranAttitudeTrendImproving">We see in your empire a potentially valuable ally, and would be happy to formalize our relationship with a treaty.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingLeaveAllianceTermTerranAttitudeTrendWorsening">Your actions have been unacceptable, and our decision on this matter is non-negotiable. </LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermTerranAttitudeTrendWorsening">In the hopes of lifting our relations from their current downward descent, we feel obliged to propose a peace treaty.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermTerranAttitudeTrendStable">The current, stable nature of our relationship has prompted The Empire to believe that a peace treaty would be mutually beneficial.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingPeaceTermTerranAttitudeTrendImproving">Improvements in our attitudes to each other have not gone unnoticed; we feel that a peace treaty is an appropriate next step.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermTerranAttitudeTrendWorsening">The existing diplomatic situation between our empires has been relatively poor. We feel driven to propose an open borders treaty in order to improve this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermTerranAttitudeTrendStable">Our current diplomatic relations being relatively stable, we think that an open border treaty could by greatly profitable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIOfferingOpenBordersTermTerranAttitudeTrendImproving">Given the excellent improvements in our mutual respect, the Empire would be honored to propose an open border treaty to better take advantage of the galaxy's riches.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermAmoebaLeft">We do not wish to offend, but we would like to confirm that this offer was not intended as humor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermAmoebaMidLeft">We cannot help but think that with a bit more effort, a mutually pleasing solution is possible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermAmoebaMidRight">Let peace commence! The Amoeba feel there is hope that our relations can improve, and even prosper.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermAmoebaRight">Gladly! Let us recycle our particle beams into industrially useful machines, and join together in a galaxy without armed conflict.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermAmoebaLeft">It is truly a moment for despair, to see two noble cultures with such great differences.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermAmoebaMidLeft">It remains difficult for us to accept this offer. Perhaps, with a bit more discussion, we could come to agreement?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermAmoebaMidRight">The Amoeba are content, even happy, to begin building long-term relations with worthy cultures.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermAmoebaRight">We hope that this is but a first step into a wider, deeper, more intimate joining of like-minded sapients.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermAmoebaLeft">We have difficulty in imagining a situation in which this would be to our mutual benefit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermAmoebaMidLeft">While it is clear this offer means much to you, it does not seem to mean quite as much as you pretend.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermAmoebaMidRight">The joining of individuals to form something greater than themselves… You speak to our greatest hopes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermAmoebaRight">All we can say is: "N'd loopvr splîn." This translates roughly as: "If we were of your species, we would wed."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermAmoebaLeft">If you insist on handling your affairs this way, we have no choice but to continue diplomacy by other means.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermAmoebaMidLeft">The colonies never view this as a desirable outcome to times of disagreement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermAmoebaMidRight">Is there truly no other way to settle our little disagreements? Truly, this path is a destructive one.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermAmoebaRight">But, no! How can it be possible that such an advanced and generous society could stoop to such barbaric acts?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendWorsening">If you insist on handling your affairs this way, we have no choice but to continue diplomacy by other means.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermAmoebaLeft">You seem very happy in your little group of friends; The Amoeba feel that it would be rude to intrude.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermAmoebaMidLeft">Such a glorious alliance is the stuff of which dreams are made. With a bit more negotiation, perhaps dreams can become reality.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermAmoebaMidRight">Had we eyes, this is the sort of generous offer that would bring tears to them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermAmoebaRight">Yes, a thousand times yes! Our apologies for the slowness of our response; one of our counselors fell into paroxysms of ecstatic joy upon hearing of your proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermAmoebaLeft">Trouble yourselves no more; soon the alliance will have nothing left of us but sad memories of failure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermAmoebaMidLeft">Departure from a group of shared minds is never easy. In this case, however, it may be for the best.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermAmoebaMidRight">The Amoeba is saddened by this thought; our alliance was a vessel for our hopes and dreams.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermAmoebaRight">If we understand the intent of your message, we fear to pass it on as it may bring torment and sadness upon many Amoeba.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermAmoebaAttitudeTrendWorsening">Trouble yourselves no more; soon the alliance will have nothing left of us but sad memories of failure.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermAmoebaLeft">In the spirit of true transparency and honesty, your proposal appears to be somewhat ridiculous.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermAmoebaMidLeft">It is hard to explain, in your language, precisely why we are not yet comfortable with your proposal. Perhaps "half-assed" is the correct word?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermAmoebaMidRight">Both logical analysis and our personal preferences are in agreement with your proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermAmoebaRight">What greater goal than joyful development in an environment of peace and happiness? This, indeed, is glorious.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermAmoebaLeft">Ah! Would that we could share true cultural discourse! It appears impossible, however, for now.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermAmoebaMidLeft">Though the Amoeba would like nothing more than to share contact and cultures, we are not quite prepared to fully accept your offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermAmoebaMidRight">We welcome you with wide open pseudopods, hoping that improving relations will cement our cultures ever more tightly together.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermAmoebaRight">We tremble with eagerness at the thought of sharing our stars and systems with such deeply appreciated friends.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermAmoebaLeft">We do not wish to offend, but we would like to confirm that this offer was not intended as humor.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermAmoebaMidLeft">It remains difficult for us to accept this offer. Perhaps, with a bit more discussion, we could come to agreement?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermAmoebaMidRight">Both logical analysis and our personal preferences are in agreement with your proposal.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermAutomatonLeft">The Automaton believe that you cannot be trusted in this matter.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermAutomatonMidLeft">The agreement, as it stands, is not yet acceptable to the Automaton.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermAutomatonMidRight">The Automaton prefer execution of its duties to war with other entities. This proposal is interesting.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermAutomatonRight">The Automaton would be remiss in our duty to refuse this excellent proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermAutomatonLeft">The reason for this proposal is unclear, as the Automaton will not co-operate with potentially dangerous alien entities.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermAutomatonMidLeft">The Automaton are not prepared to co-operate at this moment, but co-operation is not impossible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermAutomatonMidRight">Elements exist in this proposal that could aid the Automaton in their duties.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermAutomatonRight">The Automaton are convinced this will aid in the protection of those we defend.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermAutomatonLeft">Entering into such an alliance is clearly against the interests and the duties of the Automaton.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermAutomatonMidLeft">This could allow a small risk of failure in our duty, which is not acceptable or possible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermAutomatonMidRight">While the Automaton are rarely eager to trust others, doing so in this case could be advantageous.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermAutomatonLeft">The Automaton will pull back and rely on itself; the current situation is unacceptable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermAutomatonMidLeft">The Automaton preference for seclusion and distance from others indicates likelihood.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermAutomatonMidRight">In the analyses of the Automatons this is not necessary. It is not preferred.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermSwarmMidLeft">The hive will be at peace when all of you are dead.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermSwarmMidRight">The hive is not easy to convince on this matter.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermHisshoMidRight">Peace cannot come without trust, and never at the price of honor. It will be discussed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermHisshoRight">An honorable end to a righteous struggle will not bring disgrace to our people.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermHisshoLeft">The opening of our borders would disgrace those warriors who died to defend them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermHisshoMidLeft">Borders do not open upon a whim, and this proposal lacks substance.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermHoratioRight">What a surprise that people of your intelligence came up with this idea!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermHoratioLeft">Oh. Oh! The very idea makes us shudder with disgust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermHoratioMidLeft">Oh, please.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermHoratioMidRight">There are enough advantages in an alliance that Horatio is willing to put up with your oafishness. For now.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermHoratioRight">What a lovely idea. Together we can throw parties, compare fashions, and conquer the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermHoratioLeft">War with you? An excellent way to remove all the ugly you have brought to the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermHoratioMidLeft">An excellent idea. The galaxy will be a more beautiful place without you in it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermHoratioMidRight">Oh, I don't know. There are so many other things to do as well this week…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermHoratioRight">And just when things were going well. You're a terribly frustrating being, did you know that?</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermHoratioLeft">With that group? It'd be like joining a group of cavemen, but without the conversational wit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermHoratioMidLeft">Distasteful, but possible if you try a bit harder.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermHoratioMidRight">Horatio is only mildly diverted by this proposal. We will have to consider it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermHoratioRight">I suppose it's natural that you would want our beauty to enhance your little club of primates. How quaint.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermHoratioLeft">It was an ugly and unfortunate day that this alliance was created.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermHoratioMidLeft">Gladly. Horatio would grow hair just for the joy of getting you out of it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermHoratioMidRight">Very well, scuttle off. You were getting boring anyway.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermHoratioRight">Must you go so soon? The alliance was just getting interesting.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermHoratioAttitudeTrendWorsening">It was an ugly and unfortunate day that this alliance was created.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermHoratioLeft">Repulsive. If we are at peace, you'll keep trying to talk to us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermHoratioMidLeft">If we became friends, we'd see more of each other. Let's stay enemies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermHoratioMidRight">Peace is more fun than war. Though sometimes a pretty explosion is better than fireworks.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermHoratioRight">What a charming idea. And anyway, all this war activity was making a mess.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermHoratioLeft">Stay away! Horatio doesn't want to think what the place would smell like with you people around.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermHoratioMidLeft">Who would want someone like you sniffing around the palace?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermHoratioMidRight">As long as you promise to wash regularly, Horatio sees no harm in this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermHoratioRight">So you would like to come and visit? Hardly surprising. Just make a note that black is out this season, yes?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermHoratioLeft">Oh. Oh! The very idea makes us shudder with disgust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermHoratioMidLeft">Oh, please.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermHoratioMidRight">Horatio deems this possible, and is willing to put up with you for the moment.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermHoratioRight">What a surprise that people of your intelligence came up with this idea!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermResistanceLeft">Impossible. We have no reason to like or trust you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermResistanceMidLeft">I don't think this is in our best interest. Unless you come up with a better idea, we'll pass on that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermResistanceMidRight">War is a distraction from other, more important affairs. We'll think about it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermResistanceRight">I like how relations are developing, and we're wasting time and energy on these battles. Not a bad idea.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermResistanceLeft">We have been keeping an eye on you, and co-operation is not what we had in mind.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermResistanceMidLeft">The price of our co-operation is higher than that, but certainly worth it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermResistanceMidRight">The more hands we have available to help with our mission, the better. This could make sense.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermResistanceRight">Co-operation between communities is the basis of our culture. We welcome others to share in this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermResistanceLeft">The risk and the cost are too high for us to ally with you. I will not agree to it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermResistanceMidLeft">We like our allies to be a bit more predictable and reliable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermResistanceMidRight">Ship repairs, supply depots, access to sites… I can see some advantages to this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermResistanceRight">Friendship and fellowship are not to be taken lightly in the dark reaches of space. We welcome yours.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermResistanceLeft">War seems to be the only way to make your civilization listen.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermResistanceMidLeft">We may not be able to see the future as the Endless could. But still, we should have seen this one coming. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermResistanceMidRight">It comes to this, does it? Only the Endless can guess the outcome.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermResistanceRight">We would prefer other relations with your people. But if you are inclined to war, you will find us more than ready.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermResistanceMidLeft">We have our own friends and our own projects to study. We are less interested in yours.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermResistanceMidRight">There is a chance this could work out well for all of us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermResistanceRight">This offer is welcome to us; friendship and community are all part of our greater mission.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermResistanceLeft">We cannot accept an offer like that and think of ourselves as a serious nation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermResistanceMidLeft">We were thinking the same thing. Our search for the Endless was derailed by these politics.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermResistanceMidRight">There's no point pushing the question, is there? We will see our mission done, with or without you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermResistanceRight">This comes as a surprise to me. We did not realize you felt such enmity for our mission.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermResistanceAttitudeTrendWorsening">We cannot accept an offer like that and think of ourselves as a serious nation.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermResistanceLeft">I am not a supreme leader, more a coach and counselor. And I counsel strongly against this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermResistanceMidLeft">Coming from you, I'm not sure this offer is genuine. We will consider it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermResistanceMidRight">It is often preferable to war; if we learn nothing else from the Endless we should at least learn this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermResistanceRight">Our search for the Endless will certainly advance more easily in a galaxy that is at peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermResistanceLeft">Even if it facilitates our search for the Endless, this deal and these terms are utterly unacceptable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermResistanceMidLeft">We seek wherever we must; borders are not a worry for us. I don't think your offer will particularly aid our search.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermResistanceMidRight">There is some risk in your proposal. But the offer seems genuine, and I am interested.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermResistanceRight">To meet, to share, to exchange… In my experience and our philosophy, only good can come of this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermResistanceLeft">We cannot accept an offer like that and think of ourselves as a serious nation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermResistanceMidLeft">I don't think this is in our best interest. Unless you come up with a better idea, we'll pass on that.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermEmperorMidLeft">Negative on that. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermEmperorMidRight">Hmmmm. I'll talk it over with the Chiefs of Staff. Could go either way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermEmperorRight">We're with you on that. I'll give the order to stand down.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermEmperorLeft">When I'm dead. Is that clear?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermEmperorMidLeft">Sorry, but I just don't see it happening.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermEmperorMidRight">You scratch my back, I won't stab yours. Sounds like it might work.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermEmperorRight">It's a big galaxy out there. Not a bad idea to carve it up between us.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermEmperorLeft">Never happen. Not on these conditions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermEmperorMidLeft">I don't see the Legion getting tied up in this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermEmperorMidRight">That's a big one. We'll need some time to think it over. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermEmperorRight">We're good for it. Let's draw up the papers and start the party.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermEmperorLeft">It's something we're very good at. Think about that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermEmperorMidLeft">Declare war on the Sheredyn? You're gonna need more undertakers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermEmperorMidRight">It's your funeral.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermEmperorRight">Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Interrogative?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermEmperorAttitudeTrendWorsening">It's something we're very good at. Think about that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermEmperorAttitudeTrendStable">Declare war on the Sheredyn? You're gonna need more undertakers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermEmperorAttitudeTrendImproving">Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Interrogative?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermEmperorLeft">That's a negative. We're not seeing your offer as serious.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermEmperorMidLeft">Sorry, but I don't see us taking warm showers together, Ambassador.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermEmperorMidRight">That's biting off a lot, but I can see some benefits. Maybe not a bad idea?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermEmperorRight">It's good to have allies when there's this much territory. Let's talk about operational jurisdictions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermEmperorLeft">Now you're just trying to piss me off. It's working.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermEmperorMidLeft">That's a big affirmative.  I don't even have to poll the divisions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermEmperorMidRight">Not sure it's in our best interest. Do you really want the Legion mad at you?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermEmperorRight">Not a great idea. Everyone comes out worse off if you push that one through.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendWorsening">Now you're just trying to piss me off. It's working.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendStable">Not sure it's in our best interest. Do you really want the Legion mad at you?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermEmperorAttitudeTrendImproving">Not a great idea. Everyone comes out worse off if you push that one through.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermEmperorLeft">Son, we are not going to share a bunk with you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermEmperorMidLeft">We don't like the music, and you're not someone we want to dance with.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermEmperorMidRight">That might work. We could open some trade and exchange channels.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermEmperorRight">We've been sending enough coffins home. Might be time to take a shot at diplomacy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermEmperorLeft">I can't think of a port I've been in that would be better with you there.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermEmperorMidLeft">That's a negative. We're keeping the hatches locked and the powder dry.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermEmperorMidRight">Whoa, slow down. That's our territory, and we don't throw the gates open without thinking about it first.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermEmperorRight">I like the idea. But don't get fresh; we don't open wide for everybody.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermEmperorLeft">Never happen. Not on these conditions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermEmperorMidLeft">Sorry, but I just don't see it happening.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermEmperorMidRight">Hmmmm. I'll talk it over with the Chiefs of Staff. Could go either way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermEmperorRight">We're good for it. Let's draw up the papers and start the party.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermSophonLeft">Oh, stop it. That's… it's… Just go away!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermSophonMidLeft">The person who told you this was a good idea? Fire them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermSophonMidRight">Huh. A novel idea. At least you had one, and that is an improvement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermSophonRight">About time! Eventually, even you can figure out what a waste of resources war is.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermSophonLeft">What?! Tell me, when you get a cut, does it bleed stupid?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermSophonMidLeft">With you? I'm sorry, either you need a new translator or a new Alien Affairs Ministry.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermSophonMidRight">Maybe. We've got some pretty fun tech that we're hacking up right now. We might share it...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermSophonRight">Sure! We've got models, hypothesis, theorems, forecasts… There's tons of stuff to co-operate on!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermSophonLeft">An alliance with clumsy homicidal oafs? Gosh, what could go wrong?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermSophonMidLeft">What a great idea. Let's ally with dangerous fools that we don't trust. OR NOT.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermSophonMidRight">I don't know. It could happen. I'll talk with the other Proctors and we'll see.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermSophonRight">Yeah! It'll be great! Almost as fun as researching new explosives.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermSophonLeft">Great idea. Stupid has a whole new dimension, and you are the unit of measurement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermSophonMidLeft">What, did you wake up and ask yourself what you could do today that would be stupid and dangerous?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermSophonMidRight">War. Great idea. Why don't you just kill a few thousand of your own citizens and pretend you had a war? And leave us out of it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermSophonRight">What? Now? War? You? Sorry, stupidity makes me monosyllabic.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermSophonAttitudeTrendWorsening">Great idea. Stupid has a whole new dimension, and you are the unit of measurement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermSophonAttitudeTrendStable">War. Great idea. Why don't you just kill a few thousand of your own citizens and pretend you had a war? And leave us out of it?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermSophonAttitudeTrendImproving">What? Now? War? You? Sorry, stupidity makes me monosyllabic.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermSophonLeft">That sound you hear? It's us running away from this idea as fast as we can.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermSophonMidLeft">Right. Like herbivores ally with carnivores. Or Dust with mud.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermSophonMidRight">Hmmm. That might be fun. We might get to play with some stuff we haven't seen yet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermSophonRight">That'll be great! I'm sure we have lots to teach other. Well, at least we do…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermSophonLeft">To tell you the truth, I don't know why we're still in it. With friends like you, who needs infectious disease?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermSophonMidLeft">Not convinced. Sorry, we're just not convinced.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermSophonMidRight">Seriously? I don't know. We were learning some stuff and kind of having fun.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermSophonRight">What?! We didn't realize there was an idiotic idea contest under way. Congratulations on first prize.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermSophonLeft">What? How do you come up with ideas like this. Does thinking hurt?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermSophonMidLeft">What, that seemed like a clever idea when you rolled out of bed? Go back to sleep! </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermSophonMidRight">Now you're getting smarter. It's so nice when our wisdom rubs off on others.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermSophonRight">Finally. We were wondering how long it was going to take for blood to circulate above the neck over there.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermSophonLeft">What a clever thought. For you, anyway. For a Sophon, it would probably get them removed from the gene pool.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermSophonMidLeft">There might be merit in the idea, but not at this price. Sorry.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermSophonMidRight">There could be some advantages in that. We'll think about it. Thinking is fun!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermSophonRight">Great! We can explore, and test, and maybe crash things together and see what happens! Don't worry, we'll be careful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermSophonLeft">What?! Tell me, when you get a cut, does it bleed stupid?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermSophonMidLeft">The person who told you this was a good idea? Fire them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermSophonMidRight">Now you're getting smarter. It's so nice when our wisdom rubs off on others.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermSophonRight">Sure! We've got models, hypothesis, theorems, forecasts… There's tons of stuff to trade!</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermSowerLeft">Unacceptable. Recommend hostilities continue.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermSowerMidLeft">Not a preferred outcome. Positive response not recommended.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermSowerMidRight">Potential advantages have been identified. Further analysis needed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermSowerRight">Reduction in numerous Calling-inhibiting factors probable. Recommendation: Positive response.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermSowerLeft">Unreliable and/or uninteresting partner. Potential conflict with Calling. Recommendation: Negative response.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermSowerMidLeft">Co-operation possible, but insufficient risk/reward computation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermSowerMidRight">Profitable exchange possible along numerous axes. Investigate opportunity further.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermSowerRight">Improved exchange likely to confer important efficiency gains. Positive response preferred.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermSowerLeft">Statistical analysis indicates probable politico-cultural friction. Avoid execution.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermSowerMidLeft">Analysis trends slight negative. Further negotiation recommended.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermSowerMidRight">Integration into political alliance possible; logistics chain questions complex. To be discussed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermSowerRight">Current term trends indicate profitable situation and advantageous for Calling. Criteria for approval met.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermSowerLeft">Statistical projections indicated likelihood of military conflict. Prepare industrial facilities for increased output.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermSowerMidLeft">Military conflict possible/probable. Prepare response scenarios.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermSowerMidRight">Unnecessary act of aggression. Potential diversion from Calling. Additional analysis requested.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermSowerRight">Current proposal outside predictive models. Undesirable situation. Response to be determined.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermSowerLeft">Forecasts indicate low probability of success, possible interference with Calling. Not recommended</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermSowerMidLeft">Predictions unfavorable. Positive outcome possible, but not likely.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermSowerMidRight">Benefits likely to outweigh costs and penalties. More detailed review of factors recommended.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermSowerRight">Excellent probabilities of significant increase in numerous execution parameters for Calling. Recommended.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermSowerLeft">Potential benefits unacceptable. Recommendation: Reject proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermSowerMidLeft">Departure from current alliance network probable. Relations trending negatively on latest analyses.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermSowerMidRight">Secession observed to have positive and negative effects. Further study desired if possible.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermSowerRight">Current proposition an outlier compared to previous models. Departure from alliance likely to negatively impact Calling.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermSowerAttitudeTrendWorsening">Potential benefits unacceptable. Recommendation: Reject proposal.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermSowerAttitudeTrendImproving">Current proposition an outlier compared to previous models. Departure from alliance likely to negatively impact Calling.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermSowerLeft">Long-term stability of pacific relations deemed unlikely. Negative response required.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermSowerMidLeft">Cessation of conflict desired, but risk/reward analysis remains negative.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermSowerMidRight">Forecasts indicate advantages to Calling slightly outweigh inconveniences. Additional variables being considered.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermSowerRight">Improvements to current Calling projects likely to be found across disciplines. Recommendation is positive.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermSowerLeft">Trust and/or stability of other party estimated at low to very low. Approval not recommended.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermSowerMidLeft">Analysis of partner proposition interesting, but not yet acceptable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermSowerMidRight">Joint risk and exposure possible; interesting variation on Prisoner's Dilemma. To be analyzed in further detail.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermSowerRight">Improved transport and travel forecasts likely to improve current targets. Proposal has been recommended.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermSowerLeft">Potential benefits unacceptable. Recommendation: Reject proposal.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermSowerRight">Improved exchange likely to confer important efficiency gains. Positive response preferred.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermTerranLeft">We understand that you are busy fighting a war, so we'll make this simple: No.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermTerranMidLeft">A cease fire means exchanging the profits of conquest for the profits of trade. The balance is not yet in favor of commerce.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermTerranMidRight">We do not fear military solutions to problems, though we do acknowledge the usefulness of diplomacy. We will consider it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCeaseFireTermTerranRight">The fiscal advantages of war no longer apply to our situation; a change of status could well be considered.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermTerranLeft">We have studied your generous offer, and found that it doesn't meet some of our criteria -- such as common sense.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermTerranMidLeft">Co-operation should be profitable to all entities involved. Currently, your proposal is insufficient.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermTerranMidRight">Improved commerce is generally to our advantage, though in this case it is not all that simple. This calls for deliberation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCooperationAgreementTermTerranRight">We see you as a potentially profitable friend and neighbor; enhanced co-operation could be beneficial.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermTerranLeft">It is important to choose one's allies carefully, and that is why we are not choosing you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermTerranMidLeft">An alliance is a major undertaking. Right now we don't see the potential profit negating the predicted risk.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermTerranMidRight">Alliances, like marriages, depend on the trust and openness of the partners. We must consider this carefully.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingCreateAllianceTermTerranRight">We are willing to meet you at the altar. But be warned; we are neither cheap nor easy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermTerranLeft">We will not say that we wanted this war, but we do say that we are not surprised to see it happen.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermTerranMidLeft">War is not always preferable, but occasionally necessary. Are you sure this is what you want?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermTerranMidRight">We do not see war as always being profitable, but you will see that we do not fear to execute it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermTerranRight">Understand that this is likely to have a negative impact on trade and commerce. But if we must, we will.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingDeclareWarTermTerranAttitudeTrendWorsening">We will not say that we wanted this war, but we do say that we are not surprised to see it happen.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermTerranLeft">Your current proposal is far below an acceptable threshold of profitability. As such, the Empire cannot accept it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermTerranMidLeft">Joining your alliance is not, as far as we can see, fiscally interesting for the United Empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermTerranMidRight">We have watched the creation and growth of this alliance. However, we had not considered membership and must review it carefully.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingInviteToAllianceTermTerranRight">We could not help but notice the quality of your alliance, and are quite interested in helping you to exploit it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermTerranLeft">Many relationships, whatever their qualities, do come to an end. And so it is with this one.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermTerranMidLeft">Departure from the alliance is not in our best interests, given your proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermTerranMidRight">Our relationship is difficult, but divorce may not be the answer. We will consider this.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingLeaveAllianceTermTerranRight">We are not convinced that it is in our interest, or the interest of the alliance, that we secede from it.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermTerranLeft">We don't see an offer of peace as being in our best interest, nor do we see you as a reliable partner.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermTerranMidLeft">We can consider a permanent treaty, but currently the conditions are not favorable enough. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermTerranMidRight">Peace has its advantages, but also its inconveniences. We will mull over your proposal.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingPeaceTermTerranRight">It is time to turn our factories and our people to other tasks. An end to this conflict would be desirable.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermTerranLeft">While we understand that you would like to have the freedom to travel within our borders, we would like it much less.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermTerranMidLeft">Travel within the Empire is possible, but the risks involved are not outweighed by the benefits you offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermTerranMidRight">You show me yours and I'll show you mine, is it? This is a risky game, but one that we could both profit from.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOpenBordersTermTerranRight">From the Empire's point of view, increased travel and trade between our cultures can only be to the profit of both.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%DiplomaticAnswersAIRespondingOtherTermTerranLeft">We have studied your generous offer, and found that it doesn't meet some of our criteria -- such as common sense.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsExpansion04Title">MASTERY OF CELESTIAL BODIES</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsExpansion04Description">Colonization of a celestial body with an environment this hostile is not a simple thing. An empire can go far if it has such stepping stones. This can be seen as the end of the beginning of space exploration.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsExpansion05Title">TO CHANGE A PLANET</LocalizationPair>

As the number of unclaimed planets shrinks, so do the pirates' hopes of survival.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsPirates02Title">ARMADA OF THE COLLECTIVE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsPirates02Description">They are coming. Moving in groups of ships with conquest in mind, the pirates of the ABC have formed a vast fleet to conquer and pillage. This invasion has been long in planning, and will not be beaten off by a handful of vessels.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsPirates03Title">THE END OF THE COLLECTIVE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsPirates03Description">Having broken their greatest fleet and shattered their power, you have sent the once-powerful Collective into the dust of history.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsWarfare02Description">You have successfully undertaken the potentially long and expensive effort to conquer another star system. This will not go unnoticed, regardless of your status with the defending empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsShips01Title">A PLATFORM FOR SUCCESS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsShips01Description">Greater ship tonnage means many things -- greater military strength, faster travel, and an easier way to extend the power of your empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsShips02Title">LEVIATHAN!</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsMisc01Description">An alien empire has been destroyed by one of your competitors; do not be the next to be ground beneath their heel (or whatever grinding appendage they may have).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsGameIntroductionTitle">VIRTUAL AWAKENING</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsGameIntroductionDescription">The fault lies with the Automatons. Driven by their need to terraform and cultivate, it was only a matter of time before they turned their eyes to the least hospitable planets - gas giants. A scientific mission was sent to an uncolonized system, tasked to test out technology that could transform the gas giant into something livable by stripping away extraneous atmosphere and converting some of the mass into additional moons.
But as with many well-laid plans, luck and reality had other ideas.
The gas giant they targeted had a derelict platform orbiting it, a platform that was once part of the Virtual Endless war effort. But like many military installations, the Virtuals had left a guard behind. Worse yet, the system was rich in minerals from its asteroid belts, so a small but well-equipped group of Pirates were also keeping an eye on it.
As the Automatons set up their terraforming machines on the orbital, and the Pirates nosed in searching for loot, the Virtual Endless awoke and considered how best to react. Observe? Destroy? Augment? Or perhaps inhabit the body of one of the Automatons, and study the project from the inside?
Automaton, Endless, and Pirate -- an interesting enough mix. But there was a fourth and previously unknown actor, watching from the surface of the planet itself. Deep in the strange atmosphere of the gas giant, where the boundaries between gas and liquid or liquid and solid are vague and changeable, an intelligent life form watched the tether of the Endless space elevator and wondered what to do.
On board the orbital an uneasy truce was reached. Automatons continued their experiments, while the Pirates kept an eye out for profits. After all, if the technology to terraform gas giants was successfully tested, the bidding wars could make one rich indeed. The project was rolling smoothly until one of the Automatons, who had shown unusually clever behavior since landing on the orbital, pointed out that some of the radiation seeping from the planet might be in the form transmissions that form a sentient language.
Finish the testing at the risk of genocide, and sell the results? Try again elsewhere, regardless of the costs? Steal the technology and see what you can get for it? There are many questions, not the least of which is: What exactly is going on with that unusually clever Automaton?
The galaxy is about to get even stranger.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsGameIntroductionTitle1">LIGHTS OF POLARIS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsGameIntroductionDescription1">There is a strange stillness in the galaxy, a hushed moment when denizens of the many worlds seem to be taking a breath. Perhaps they are preparing themselves for the next phase of work or war, perhaps they are simply relaxing after long toil. As the galactic year comes to an end living beings take stock of where they are and what they want to achieve; mechanicals recoup their strength and prepare their future tasks. And in this interlude of unexpected peace, somewhere, far in the northern hemisphere of a great arctic planet, beneath the cold snow and the wailing winds, there has been a discovery. 
 
Rumbling forever below the glaciers, an old installation of the Endless, still tended by descendants of the original workers, churns tirelessly throughout the frozen nights. Raw materials are collected, goods are produced and packaged, and an endless stream of boxes disappear into ships, portals, and sleds for distribution. What is this unceasing travail? What is the purpose of these strange, colorful, impractical objects that they build? They are not weapons nor tools, but something else; something whose utility lies just a step outside what is purely practical.
 
Should you receive some of these objects and be surprised by what they are, look for Mr Erram Zen Eerbee. There is an ancient secret there from before the time of space travel; a secret that is hidden behind the twinkle in his eyes...</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsGameIntroductionTitle2">ECHOES OF THE ENDLESS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%NarrativeEventsGameIntroductionDescription2">"...Like an earthquake or a tidal wave, like a birth or a blossoming, something has awakened the ancient infrastructures of the Endless. Empty planets now show signs of Endless technology, which seems to be rebooting itself in response to a strange signal that is propagating across the galaxy -- a signal from the system where we last saw Jana Kryv, almost two years ago. Systems that slept for centuries are coming back on line, and many things are not what they appear to be. What we thought were rocks may be bases, what we thought were wrecks may be viable ships.
 
But we must walk cautiously among the relics of the Endless; though we seek to pierce their mysteries we are not yet on a level with their knowledge. We must travel farther, think harder, and work faster than ever before. It is more than our holy mission that is at risk now; it is the shape and the future of the galaxy as we know it..."
 
- Excerpt from a speech by Kamau Savasbat, Patriarch, A.B. 112</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent01Title">DUST CODE CRACKED</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent01Description">Partially, anyway. Applied mathematicians (the team of Trasman, Orkim, and Edrik) have decrypted some of the algorithms underlying the structure and communication between Dust particles, and partially replicated their networking processes. A chain reaction results in a boost to scientific development across the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent02Title">DUST LODE SELF-ACTIVATES</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent02Description">How exciting! After years of research, a team of scientists led by Norzk has managed to get Dust to demonstrate some of its self-organizing and networking properties. Unfortunately, the Dust subsequently became uncooperative, sabotaged a number of on-going experiments, and triggered incidents across the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent03Title">HULK DISCOVERED WITH ENDLESS TECH</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent03Description">The dead hulk of a ship belonging to the Endless has been discovered drifting among the debris of an asteroid belt. The technology has been analyzed, and your vessels will benefit from a significant boost in speed. Unfortunately this occurred during a diplomatic conclave, so all factions will benefit.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent04Title">ENDLESS SIGNALS TECH DISCOVERED</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent04Description">Using leftover Endless technology and partially animated Dust, signaling systems were augmented around your home planet. This improved your detection range and extended your broadcast range, thus also extending your cultural influence. The lead scientist fled, set up a company called SpinMaster, and has sold the tech to all factions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent05Title">DARK MATTER REACTS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent05Description">Experiments into the nature of dark matter and non-baryonic particles have had an unexpected side effect; local gravity fluctuations and atypical radiation indicate some sort of chain reaction among the particles that make up dark matter. Blame Reynuy, the scientist who started it all.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent06Title">TRADE TREATY GENIUS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent06Description">Who the heck is that?? From out of nowhere a negotiator only described as "Some Guy" has risen through the ranks, showing a stunning ability to promote trade and open previously closed markets. As trade improves, all factions benefit from the talents of this charismatic character who can only be described as awesome to the max.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent07Title">EXPLORER DESECRATES ENDLESS TEMPLE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent07Description">It was most likely ignorance or accident, but a team of explorers inadvertently destroyed a site of Endless remains via an unplanned evacuation of their ship's sewage system. Factions across the galaxy are up in arms at this act of disrespect, and a number of trade relations have been ruined. The career of a certain Maukla Bogyor is almost certainly at an end.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent08Title">SUPPORTIVE MEDIA</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent08Description">There is nothing quite like a friendly popular press. Thanks to a few very wily development decisions, a wealthy media baron has been able to sell feel-good messages to populations across the galaxy. Governmental popularity has skyrocketed, treasuries are profiting, and a CEO named Shadirann has purchased an entire constellation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent09Title">DIVISIVE POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent09Description">A swell of popular discontent is causing trouble across all empires. Strong differences of opinion on strategic diplomatic decisions have resulted in a divisive and angry political atmosphere. Revenues and production are being affected and the popularity of all governments are falling. The effect is attributed to a rebellious NGO nicknamed the Jolly Jokers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent10Title">INVASION RUMORS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent10Description">While nothing has been proven, popular (though perhaps unfounded) rumors of an impending invasion from an alien force called the 'Jetcars' has driven the populace to prefer known enemies to unknown threats. All diplomatic relationships are being changed to Peace under pressure from fearful citizens.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent11Title">IMPROVED SENSORS CHANGE RESOURCE RESERVE DATA</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent11Description">Advances in sensing and divination technology from the team led by Prof. Ourip have changed the estimates of resource reserves. Previously non-existent lodes have been discovered, and previously over-estimated lodes have been downgraded. In a magnanimous move, this technology has been shared with other factions.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent12Title">SUBTERRANEAN ENDLESS TREASURES DISCOVERED</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent12Description">It is the discovery of the millennia. On a neutral planet, ancient bunkers from the Concrete branch of the Endless civilization were uncovered during a routine exploration. A stronghold, storehouse, and safehouse during their fratricidal wars, the ruins are a rich source of both knowledge and Dust, and their discovery provides wonderful media exposure.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent13Title">CORRUPTION AND NEPOTISM SCANDAL</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%GlobalRandomEvent13Description">It appears that a band of planetary governors, acting in what they claimed to be the best interests of the galaxy, had been enriching themselves and filling important posts with incompetent lackeys. Though security services uncovered the plot, codenamed 'Hardcore Game,' the fallout is still horrific. Colonial governments crumble, corporations turn out to be bankrupt shells, and popular support plummets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent01Title">ENDLESS MAP ARTIFACT DISCOVERED</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent01Description">It was a tiny thing; a bit of unsecured unencrypted data drifting as part of an Endless wreck. However, it has provided a significant extension to the range of ship sensor systems and greatly improved local mapping.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent02Title">PARTIAL DUST RE-ANIMATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent02Description">Enough Dust has been uncovered, and enough attuned Heroes are using it, that a partially sentient pulse was transmitted across Dust-affected sentients. In a brief moment of shared knowledge and experience, the capacities of your Heroes took a significant jump.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent03Title">LEGENDARY WRECK ANALYZED</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent03Description">In lore it was known as the Bel Riannoh, an ancient ship of the Endless cursed to wander the cosmos as it searched for the mythical Beginning of Time. The wreck itself has been discovered, and its crew -- before their death or disappearance, for the ship is empty -- apparently reworked it with armor of incredible thickness and durability.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent04Title">SUCCESSFUL SKUNKWORKS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent04Description">As with most scientific and tech teams, there is always a secret project or two underway that the bosses don't know about. In this case, the teams in question -- led by O. Gret and Z. Ormar -- have simultaneously (and unexpectedly) discovered other technologies that were theorized but not officially under investigation.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent05Title">UNEXPECTED EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent05Description">Sometimes chance and accident are as important to science as planning and research. This time, an unexpected discovery in the course of routine lab work at has uncovered an advanced technology. The bewildered technologist who did it, Dengran, is still not sure why it turned out that way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent06Title">GRAVITY ANOMALIES GENERATE PLANETOIDS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent06Description">The problem with poking and prying vaguely understood particles is that they may react in unexpected ways. What happened here was a sudden accretion of high-gravity loci in planetary orbits; the orbits themselves were unaffected, but enough near-planet objects were smashed together to create new moons in a process now known as Antula-smashing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent07Title">DUST-BASED SCANNING TECH FOUND</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent07Description">The search for Endless artifacts and temples, in spite of the fact that it sounds like archaeology, requires the most advanced sciences. Thanks to improvements in sensing equipment based on Dust networks and signal typologies, previously hidden Endless temples can now be discovered.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent08Title">A RIP IN THE FABRIC…</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent08Description">Space-time is a strange and occasionally unpleasant place. This time, however, a series of unexpected space-time rifts have generated useful anomalies in your star systems. The event is known as SABA, for "Simultaneous Anomaly Breakthrough Appearance."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent09Title">PLANETARY OBJECT ACCRETION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent09Description">The rogue cosmic body codenamed Pitbull struck a large planetoid in one of your systems, cretaing a new planet. The act awoke a robot sentience that had slept undiscovered within Pitbull, and it immediately transformed and terraformed the resulting object using advanced Davea-injection xenomorphing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent10Title">TIME-SPACE ANOMALY YIELDS SHIP</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent10Description">A side effect of the use of powerful ship motors is that we don't really know what precisely happens to the fabric of space-time at supralight velocities. In this case, a double of a colony ship has materialized in one of your systems; don't ask questions because the mathematics could drive you as insane as the scientist who now only repeats, "The galaxy is stretchy, like cheese...".</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent11Title">PATRIOTIC FLEET</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomPositiveEvent11Description">There are citizen associations whose political and moral agendas can range from quaint to mentally imbalanced. Fortunately, this group of pro-government volunteers, in tandem with the military, has managed to pull together scrapped, retired, damaged, and discovered ships in enough quantity to create a viable fleet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomNegativeEvent01Title">SUPERNOVA DISRUPTS NAVIGATION MAPS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomNegativeEvent01Description">An unexplored and largely unimportant star, MT-K4, went supernova, and the resultant shock and radiation wave has caused havoc on interstellar navigation and positioning systems. Until such systems can be recalibrated, there will be navigational and sensor difficulties.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomNegativeEvent02Title">SYSTEMIC SENSOR FAILURE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomNegativeEvent02Description">It is said that one should keep one's friends close, and one's enemies closer. In this case, an enemy seems to have gotten close enough to infiltrate production lines and trigger a chain sabotage of sensor systems, causing a radar and sensor blackout across the empire. It is unlikely that you will continue to source components from Nosfaretiel Inc.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomNegativeEvent03Title">FANATIC REBELS SUICIDE BOMB NAVY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomNegativeEvent03Description">Your navy has been the victim of a long-term, carefully planned act of sabotage. A group of fanatics known as the Church of Alderbaranch, led by a megalomaniac who calls himself 'Justice,' have triggered a series of bombs across your vessels. Such action can only be described as "immoderate."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomNegativeEvent04Title">SYSTEM SUBTERFUGE</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomNegativeEvent04Description">A group of hackers calling themselves the "Macemen" have apparently gained root access to a number of highly sensitive defense systems. Working through a number of leaders or figureheads known as Zep', OldCat, and Bazshot, they have sabotaged your star system defense systems. So far, the only public demand has been some sort of gibberish about "immediate beta access."</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomNegativeEvent05Title">ENGINE CONTROL TECH FAULT DISCOVERED</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomNegativeEvent05Description">In their race to develop technology, it appears that the technical team behind the company that produces your starship engines cut a few corners that should have been left squared. In order to avoid catastrophic system failure when certain events (like attaining full speed) occur, it is necessary to reduce all speed on all ships by half.</LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomNegativeEvent06Description">This is inconvenient.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomNegativeEvent07Description">And the really sad news is that they did it by accident.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%FactionRandomNegativeEvent09Description">One of the side effects of highly developed life science is highly resistant diseases.

  <LocalizationPair Name="%Achievement_InteractiveGalacticTempestTitle">UNSTABLE PORTAL</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%Achievement_InteractiveGalacticTempestDescription">Whatever Kryv triggered, one of the side effects appears to be a partial re-opening of an old Endless portal. Either due to a lack of energy or failed technology, the opening is not stable and cannot be used (though it appears to lead to a separate galaxy or parallel universe). Instead, the portal will likely cause serious damage to commerce and even surface structures within the system due to strong waves of gravity and electro-magnetic radiation pulsing from it.</LocalizationPair>

If you disable the Tutorial with the button below, you can re-activate it in the game options. You can restart a new game to make sure you have not missed any Tutorial information.
 
Press OK to proceed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialGalaxyViewTitle">GALAXY VIEW</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialGalaxyViewItem0">This screen is an overview of the game galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialGalaxyViewItem1">Your home system is centered on the screen. Zoom in/out using the mouse wheel. Press the left mouse button and drag to move the view. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialGalaxyViewItem2">The control banner at the top of the screen gives you access to the different departments of your empire. Hovering over these icons displays status information.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialGalaxyViewItem3">You conquer the galaxy by colonizing Star Systems. Each Star System holds up to 6 diverse planets. The dots over the star name indicate the number and type of planets: Blue are already colonized, white planets are colonizable, red planets cannot be colonized yet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialGalaxyViewItem4">Stars are connected by cosmic strings, natural links which allow fast travel. Other, more advanced means of travelling can be unlocked later.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialGalaxyViewItem5">The flag above a star system informs that a unique exploration event awaits the very first player to travel this far. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialGalaxyViewItem6">When an important event occurs, usually at the beginning of the turn, an icon appears. Clicking on the icon will open a detailed panel, which you can either minimize or dismiss (like the icon).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialGalaxyViewItem7">The auto-cycle button allows you to review all your fleets that remain around planets, waiting for your orders.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialGalaxyViewItem8">All planned moves of your fleets can be executed automatically thanks to the forced-move button. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialGalaxyViewItem9">Once you have completed all of your actions for the turn, press the end-turn button in the lower right corner to advance constructions and research as well as move ships and fleets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewTitle">SYSTEM VIEW</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewItem0">This screen shows a Star System's status and allows you to manage its production.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewItem1">The Star System name is displayed here; click on it to change it if you wish.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewItem2">A Star System produces four basic outputs: Food, Industry, Dust, and Science. Together, they are known as FIDS.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewItem3">A Star System's population increases when there is sufficient food output. The more population units the planet has, the more FIDS it will generate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewItem4">The Star System's Approval represents how happy the people are in this system. This will affect the FIDS output.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewItem5">Your Star System contains up to 6 planets of various types. You start with one colonized planet, and may need more advanced technology to colonize new planet types. The base FIDS production of each planet is multiplied by its current population, then added to the system's FIDS.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewItem6">When you control more than one planet in a system, you can drag and drop population units between them to optimize the FIDS output.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewContinuedTitle">SYSTEM VIEW (continued)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewContinuedItem1">In the Development panel you can add Star System Improvements or ships to the production queue.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewContinuedItem2">Once a construction has been selected, it appears in the Star System production queue. Next to it you can see the number of turns required to complete it. If you hover over the 'Dust' symbol you will see the cost required to complete the construction in 1 turn. Click the symbol if you wish to do this. You can drag and drop items to change their order in the queue.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewContinuedItem3">When a spaceship is built, it is stored in the Star System's hangar. The ship will remain in the hangar until you assemble it into a fleet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewContinuedItem4">Some Star System Improvements have an upkeep cost. They can be scrapped if your empire's treasury runs low.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewContinuedItem5">You can assign a Hero to govern a Star System. Depending on their specializations, the Hero can provide bonuses in things like production output, defense, etc.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewContinuedItem6">If Luxury or Strategic Resources are present, they become available throughout your empire. These resources allow advanced constructions, and can be traded with friendly empires. If an enemy fleet is in orbit, that Star System is in a Blockade. It can no longer share resources with your or any other empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialSystemViewContinuedItem7">When you are at Peace with at least one empire, Trade Routes are automatically created. They provide bonuses in Dust and Science. A Star System under Blockade (with an enemy fleet present) loses all its Trade routes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialPlanetViewTitle">PLANET VIEW</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialPlanetViewItem0">Clicking on a planet provides details of the planet. From here you can select advanced planetary options.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialPlanetViewItem1">Planet types vary in terms of FIDS outputs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialPlanetViewItem2">A planet may hold an Anomaly, which can alter (for better or worse) its FIDS and other values. It may also hold a Wonder, a Natural or an Endless one, which gives a boost to the planet or the whole system.To activate an Endless Wonder, the structure must be rebuilt first.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialPlanetViewItem3">A planet may also hold a Luxury or Strategic Resource, which usually requires research of a specific technology to receive those bonuses.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialPlanetViewItem4">The planet population is defined by maximum (white) and a current (blue) values. The current value represents the active population, which is multiplied by the base FIDS output of the planet to determine its contribution to the system FIDS.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialPlanetViewItem5">Once you have colonized a Star System from a ship, you can colonize other planets inside that system from the Planet View (provided you have discovered the right technology for that planet type).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialPlanetViewContinuedTitle">PLANET VIEW (continued)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialPlanetViewContinuedItem0">There are many development options for a planet once it has been colonized.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialPlanetViewContinuedItem1">Each planet can have one type of exploitation, which specializes it to producing one of the FIDS. You can only have one exploitation at a time on a planet, but you can replace it with a different one.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialPlanetViewContinuedItem2">Some negative Anomalies can be countered by Anomaly Reduction options, when the proper technology has been discovered.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialPlanetViewContinuedItem3">When unlocked through research, Terraforming options allow you to change one planet type to another.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialPlanetViewContinuedItem4">A planet may have a moon. Once you have done a Moon Survey, the moon may reveal a hidden temple. These temples can provide critical advantages to the Star System, and even to your Empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialPlanetViewContinuedItem5">Colonization, exploitations, anomaly reductions, terraformations and moon surveys are all stacked in the system construction queue, which will implement them one at a time.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialFleetControlTitle">FLEET CONTROL</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialFleetControlItem0">This panel is for managing fleets and ships in Galaxy View.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialFleetControlItem1">The spaceship symbol next to your home planet represents one or more fleets. When you click on this symbol, a fleet control panel appears, and the fleet (or fleets) are selected.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialFleetControlItem2">In the fleet list half of the panel (left), you can see the details of each fleet. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialFleetControlItem3">Selecting an individual fleet displays the list of ships in that fleet on the right. You can drag and drop ships from fleet to fleet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialFleetControlItem4">Once a fleet is selected, order it to move by right-clicking on a destination star (connected by a string). The fleet will start moving, but may take more than one turn to arrive at its destination. Technology advances will speed up this movement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialFleetControlItem5">The Fleet Control panel also has some special actions, which will blink when available. For example, when a fleet containing a colony ship orbits a Star System, you can press the blinking Colonize button to settle one of the planets in that Star System.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireViewTitle">EMPIRE VIEW</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireViewItem0">This screen gives you an overview of your empire. You can also perform actions on your Star Systems from here.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireViewItem1">This is your empire's Dust treasury, as well as the projected income / loss for the next turn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireViewItem2">This is your empire's Approval rating. The more content your citizens are, the more they will produce and research, and the faster your population will grow. Empire Approval is the average of each Star System's Approval, weighted by population.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireViewItem3">Increasing your Tax rate will also increase your Dust production, but will reduce your Approval. Reducing the Tax rate will have the opposite effect.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireViewItem4">The list of Star Systems can be sorted in different ways by clicking on the header tab for each column.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireViewItem5">Clicking on the appropriate cell allows you to manage a planet's population, assign heroes, change the production queue, and manage the ships in the hangar.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireViewItem6">You can also ask the AI to take over a system's management. Select the area you want the AI to focus on from the drop down list.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireViewItem7">This is a quick overview of all the bonus / penalty factors that currently affect your empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireViewItem8">This is the list of all the effects generated by your Trade Routes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewTitle">RESEARCH VIEW</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewItem0">This screen allows you to research new technologies to improve your empire. The technologies are divided into four main categories. The farther away from the center, the more advanced the technology is. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewItem1">"Exploration and Expansion" allows you to navigate faster and farther, unlock new spaceship hulls, and colonize or improve new planet types.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewItem2">"Applied Sciences" are for improving your empire's economy and sciences, as well as discovering Strategic Resources.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewItem3">"Diplomacy and Trade" helps you in agriculture, diplomacy, and finance, and also helps you manage your citizens.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewItem4">"Galactic Warfare" unlocks new combat modules to outfit your ships, and makes ships more efficient in combat.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewItem5">When you click on a technology, you select it and its associated modules for research. Technologies are researched one at a time, and research advances to the next queued technology when one is complete.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewItem6">You can consult your research rate and queued technologies in this panel.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewItem7">You can use the mouse wheel or scale control to zoom in or out.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewContinuedTitle">RESEARCH VIEW (continued)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewContinuedItem0">When you zoom in all the way, you can see the details of each research option.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewContinuedItem1">Each technology has a research cost (in Science points) that is directly converted into the number of turns it takes to research.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewContinuedItem2">When technology research is completed (blue), it unlocks improvements of various kinds: Star System improvements, new ship hulls, planetary exploitations... Basically, everything in the game.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewContinuedItem3">Technologies are connected by dependencies. To research a technology, you must have discovered at least one technology connected to it (closer to the center of the wheel).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewContinuedItem4">The technology currently being researched is surrounded by a green wave pattern. Other technologies in the research queue are also colored in green.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewContinuedItem5">Some technologies are specific to the empire you play; those have an orange icon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialResearchViewContinuedItem6">If you are looking for a specific technology or module/improvement, simply type a keyword in the Quick Find box and hit return. You can then cycle through the matching elements.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewTitle">MILITARY VIEW</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewItem0">You can consult your military status on this view -- both active fleets and available Ship Designs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewItem1">Fleets are presented in rows that show detailed information on the fleet stats as well as its location. Double-clicking on a fleet will open and center the Galaxy View on this fleet's location.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewItem2">When you select a single fleet by clicking it, the ships contained in this fleet are displayed in the area below. You can drag and drop ships between fleets if the fleets are located in the same Star System.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewItem3">Selecting fleets and ships will open up options for managing them.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewItem4">If you hold “Ctrl” while selecting fleets, you can select multiple fleets. Fleets can be merged if they orbit the same Star System.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewItem5">If you disband a fleet, for instance to reduce your empire upkeep, its ships will be returned to the hangar if the fleet orbits one of your Star Systems. Otherwise, the ships are scrapped.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewItem6">Use the Retrofit button to upgrade Ships or entire fleets to the latest revision of their Ship Design. This will cost you some Dust.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewContinuedTitle">MILITARY VIEW (continued)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewContinuedItem1">Available Ship Designs shows the current Ship Designs created for your empire. A Ship Design is a template which can be used to produce ships in your Star Systems. Ship designs can be modified and evolved through “revisions”, as you research new ship modules or change your strategies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewContinuedItem2">You can create new Ship Designs anytime, and should do so when a new ship class becomes available. Ship designs can be removed, but this will prevent you from retrofitting any older ships in your fleets that have that design.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewContinuedItem3">When you select a Ship Design or a ship within a fleet, you will see detailed information on its design.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewContinuedItem4">The Ship Design Details panel displays various statistics for a Ship Design, as well as the types and numbers of ship modules outfitted to that ship. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewContinuedItem5">The Military Power (MP) is a compound representation of a ship's combat strength, combining offense and defense.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewContinuedItem6">Modules are organized in categories, with the total weight and effect (usually MP) summarized.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialMilitaryViewContinuedItem7">Click the Modify button to edit a Ship Design.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialShipDesignViewTitle">SHIP DESIGN VIEW</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialShipDesignViewItem0">The Ship Design view is used to create new Ship Designs or modify existing ones. Basically, a Ship Design is the combination of a ship class (or hull) and a list of ship modules. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialShipDesignViewItem1">When you create a new Ship Design, you select a ship class here. Ship classes vary in tonnage and also offer special bonuses to certain module types. The greater the tonnage, the more Industry points the ship will cost to build.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialShipDesignViewItem2">If this is a new Ship Design, you must give it a name of your choosing.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialShipDesignViewItem3">The tonnage is an absolute limit to how many ship modules you can build into a ship. Some technologies allow you increase the ship tonnage capacity through miniaturization.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialShipDesignViewItem4">As you progress in the game, you will discover new modules to install in your ships. Use these tabs to switch between the families of modules: Weapon, Defense, and Support.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialShipDesignViewItem5">To install a module on a ship, simply click on the module in the “Available Modules” area.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialShipDesignViewContinuedTitle">SHIP DESIGN VIEW (continued)</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialShipDesignViewContinuedItem1">Modules will be disabled (gray) if their weight exceeds the remaining tonnage capacity or, as in this case, if the module requires access to a Strategic Resource. You can still create a Ship Design with these modules, but you must have access to the Strategic Resource via colonization or Trade to build ships based on that Ship Design.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialShipDesignViewContinuedItem2">The “Selected Modules” area summarizes the modules currently selected for the Ship Design. Simply click on a module to remove it from the Ship Design and free up some hull space.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialShipDesignViewContinuedItem3">You can click the auto-upgrade button to automatically fill up the ship with modules. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialShipDesignViewContinuedItem4">Once you are finished, click the Create/Apply button.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialAcademyViewTitle">ACADEMY</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialAcademyViewItem0">The Academy is where you hire or manage Heroes, powerful characters who can greatly improve the efficiency of your Star Systems and fleets. The Academy is separated into two parts: the management of active Heroes, and the recruitment of new Heroes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialAcademyViewItem1">When you click on the lower part, you switch the top and bottom halves of the View. Whenever you enter the screen it is set to Hero management on top (assign or re-assign Heroes to fleets and systems, inspect their abilities) and Hero recruitment on bottom (a list of available Heroes, if any).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialAcademyViewItem2">When one of the two lists is selected, its available actions appear as you select each Hero. These actions will depend on the list (manage or recruit) and the situation of the hero (not hired, idle, injured, assigned to a fleet, etc.).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialAcademyViewItem3">When you start the game, some Heroes are available for hire. More will come after a number of turns. To hire a Hero, select the recruit list, select the Hero, and click the Hire button. This will deduct the hiring cost from your treasury.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialAcademyViewItem4">Once a Hero is hired, his/her upkeep cost will be subtracted from your empire treasury each turn. If you are having financial problems you can Expel a hero to save Dust, but he will leave your empire permanently.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialAcademyViewItem5">The standard activity for an active hero is to manage a fleet or a Star System, which you perform by clicking on the Assign buttons in the manage list. The game also offers many shortcuts to assign heroes directly from the Star System View or Fleet View interfaces.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialAcademyViewItem6">If you want to know more about a Hero, you can click the Inspect button to check out their information and abilities.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialHeroInspectionViewTitle">HERO INSPECTION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialHeroInspectionViewItem0">The Hero inspection panel displays critical information about a Hero, and also allows you to select new abilities as your Hero progresses in skill.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialHeroInspectionViewItem1">A Hero's overall power is defined by their level, which is the same for both classes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialHeroInspectionViewItem2">Each Hero has two classes (out of 5 possible) which determine their ability to perform certain missions. Some Heroes will be more adapted to governing Star Systems, others to commanding fleets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialHeroInspectionViewItem3">The upkeep cost of the Hero needs to be paid each turn by your empire, and increases as the Hero gains levels.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialHeroInspectionViewItem4">The Hero attributes determine the bonus they bring to a Star System or fleet. These attributes can be increased by selecting certain abilities when the Hero gains a level.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialHeroInspectionViewItem5">When a Hero has gained enough experience governing a Star System or commanding a fleet, they gain a new level and can unlock a new ability.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialHeroInspectionViewItem6">As long as you have ability points left, you can select an ability to acquire it for the Hero.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialHeroInspectionViewItem7">This area summarizes all the bonuses provided by the Hero.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialDiplomacyViewTitle">DIPLOMATIC STATUS</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialDiplomacyViewItem0">The Diplomacy View shows your diplomatic status with other empires, and lets you contact them to make (or break) agreements.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialDiplomacyViewItem1">When you open this view, you as the emperor are in the center, represented by a holographic figure. Around you are pedestals for the leaders of the other empires in the game. These will be empty until you make contact with those empires.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialDiplomacyViewItem2">Your status with other empires is shown by the lines radiating from your image. The color and symbols of those lines represent the current diplomatic situation: War, Cold War, Peace, or Alliance. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialDiplomacyViewItem3">The attitudes towards the centered empire are displayed through emotional icons. It gives a quick overview of the relationship status between empires in addition to the line type. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialDiplomacyViewItem4">You can click on another emperor to center them in the view and see their relations with other empires.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialDiplomacyViewItem5">When an empire is selected, you can click the Inspection icon to show information about this empire (including your own).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialDiplomacyViewItem6">Once an empire is selected, you can click the Contact icon to open negotiations with this empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialNegotiationViewTitle">DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialNegotiationViewItem0">Once you have contacted an empire, the diplomatic negotiations panel opens to allow you to prepare the terms of the deal you want to offer. Your empire is represented on the left part of the screen, the other empire on the right.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialNegotiationViewItem1">A deal is an exchange of diplomatic terms. The other empire must agree to the deal for it to become active, unless you are declaring War -- they get no choice on that.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialNegotiationViewItem2">You can switch between different categories of terms with these tabs: Treaties to change your status or to exchange Dust, technologies, or Star Systems.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialNegotiationViewItem3">Select items from the list that appears in order to determine your offer.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialNegotiationViewItem4">Select terms or items from the contacted empire to explain what you want to request in return for what you are offering.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialNegotiationViewItem5">Once you are ready, you can click the “Offer” button to send your proposal to the contacted empire. Note: They will not necessarily accept it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialNegotiationViewItem6">In parallel with the written reaction of the contacted empire, the deal balance gauge lets you know how likely it is that the deal will succeed, to make sure you do not offer too much or too little. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialNegotiationViewItem7">The different resources are displayed for both empire. Numbers on the left are the amount at disposal for an offer and numbers on the right are what the empire receives in total (through current deals for instance).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialNegotiationViewItem8">Use these buttons to see your previous deals with this empire (or all empires).</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireInformationViewTitle">EMPIRE INFORMATION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireInformationViewItem0">This panel gives information on an empire, and lists the deals you have signed with it. When you select your own empire, you will see your own empire information and all the deals signed with other empires.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireInformationViewItem1">The current status is shown here, as well as this empire's attitude towards you. If they like you, it will be easier to strike deals or even form a long term alliance.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireInformationViewItem2">The score is a good indication of how well this empire is doing. You can also check the score by hovering on the galaxy icon of the Galaxy View banner.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireInformationViewItem3">This area lists all the accumulated faction traits of this empire. This can tell you how dangerous this empire might be, or what its preferred path to victory is.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireInformationViewItem4">This part summarizes the deals currently in progress with the empire.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireInformationViewItem5">You can terminate a deal by clicking this button.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireInformationViewItem6">However, killing a deal will incur an attitude penalty with the other empire. This penalty gradually decreases as turns pass.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelTitle">ENCOUNTER PANEL</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelItem1">When an optional battle is possible at the arrival around a system, the Fleet Attack icon starts blinking.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelItem2">Clicking this icon opens the Encounter Panel, which gives you critical information before the battle. This panel opens automatically if the enemy attacks you. Your forces are shown on the left, the enemy's forces on the right.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelItem3">The strength of each fleet is represented by its health and military power, which is the sum of all ships of the fleet.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelItem4">You can see the order of battle of the ships participating in the battle, and hover your cursor to check their stats.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelItem5">The balance of power gauge represents your chances of winning the battle. It compares the product of current health percentage by military power for you and your opponent.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelItem6">If you feel secure enough to win the battle you can play it in Auto mode; otherwise, select the Manual option to visualize and direct the encounter.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialBattleViewTitle">BATTLE VIEW</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialBattleViewItem0">The Battle View opens when one of your fleets confronts the enemy in a Star System. This view also allows you to choose Battle Actions to increase your chances of winning the engagement.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialBattleViewItem1">The battle is subdivided into phases: A prologue, three combat phases, and an epilogue phase. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialBattleViewItem2">The three combat phases are also shown in your Fleet Command interface.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialBattleViewItem3">During the long range phase, missiles are more effective. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialBattleViewItem4">During the medium range phase, beams are more effective. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialBattleViewItem5">During the melee phase, kinetic weapons are more effective. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialBattleViewItem6">You can select a Battle Action for each combat phase.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialBattleViewItem7">The list of ships into the current fleet is shown with a real-time state update.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialBattleViewItem8">The battle can end in a victory, defeat, or even a draw if both fleets survive. Survivors can resume the fight on the next turn.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialActionChoicePanelTitle">BATTLE ACTION PANEL</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialActionChoicePanelItem0">When you click on the Battle Action icon for each combat phase, the Battle Action choice panel appears. Simply click on a card to select it.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialActionChoicePanelItem1">The Battle Actions are presented as cards. Each one has a color that corresponds to their action "family." The family is also displayed on top of the card. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialActionChoicePanelItem2">Each card can counter another family of cards, resulting in an improved effect for the action. The countered family is displayed at the bottom of the card.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialActionChoicePanelItem3">Some Battle Action cards are free to use, requiring 0 Dust to activate. Those are technological actions, unlocked through scientific research.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialActionChoicePanelItem4">Some action cards require Dust to activate, but their effect is quasi magical in nature, due to the uncanny ability of Heroes to create powerful effects by manipulating Dust. Those actions are unlocked by your Heroes as they gain levels, and they must be an admiral in the battling fleet for their actions to be available.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialActionChoicePanelItem5">When you do not have enough Dust to activate an action, it is grayed out and the cost is displayed in red.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialActionChoicePanelItem6">The Battle Action cards list the base and improved effects of the action. You can check your available Battle Actions at any time via the Fleet Control panel.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelReportTitle">ENCOUNTER PANEL, BATTLE REPORT</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelReportItem0">Once a battle is resolved, you can check the Battle Report in the Encounter Panel.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelReportItem1">The health and Military Power of remaining ships are updated.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelReportItem2">Destroyed and surviving ships are displayed for each side.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelReportItem3">Global statistics summarize your ship losses and show how much XP a Hero has earned.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelReportItem4">If a Hero was injured, they are returned to your Academy, waiting to be healed.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelReportItem5">The second column displays how much damage you inflicted on the enemy as well as the efficiency percentage (how much damage passed through the enemy defenses) for each of your active weapon types.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEncounterPanelReportItem6">The last column is the opposite, showing how much damage the enemy inflicted on you, and how efficient your defenses were against incoming enemy weapons. Analyzing offensive and defensive stats will allow you to optimize your ship designs to better defeat your enemies.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireExpansionTitle">EMPIRE EXPANSION</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireExpansionItem0">You will be able to colonize other Star Systems soon after you start playing the game.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireExpansionItem1">Newly colonized Star Systems start as Outposts, gradually evolving into full-fledged Colonies. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireExpansionItem2">Colonies generate a border around them, which defines your empire's frontiers. This territory expands as the system grows.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireExpansionItem3">Spaceships have a detection range, which reveals nearby enemy ships.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireExpansionItem4">When you meet with new empires you share a status of Cold War. That is unchanged unless you declare war or are able to negotiate peace.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireExpansionItem5">When in Cold War, all ships can engage in battle outside of their empire territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%TutorialEmpireExpansionItem6">Outposts control no territory until they become full Colonies. They can be invaded by enemy forces without a declaration of war as they are not yet part of your empire territory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitleTerran01">They're not so united, the planets of this "United Empire. "</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitleTerran02">It's more a gaggle of unruly imperial corporations run by insolent dukes.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitleTerran03">But their armies are strong, their economy is efficient,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitleTerran04">… and their ships are powerful. I fear that they may be the ones</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitleTerran05">… who will finally unite -- or dominate -- the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitleTerran06">They'll turn it into a shrine to the gods of commerce;</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitleTerran07">… a profane church with Emperor Maximilian Zelevas as its high priest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitleSwarm01">The normal attitude toward the Cravers is fear.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitleSwarm02">Half-insect, half-machine, their only desire is to expand </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitleSwarm03">… and conquer and devour to feed their hives.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitleSwarm04">They have little understanding of pain or fear or defeat.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitleSwarm05">For the Endless built them that way; a living weapon.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitleSwarm06">And if they do not expand, they will consume themselves.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitleSwarm07">And their hive leader would much prefer to consume you.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHoratio01">They are the Horatio, created from cloning technology of the Endless. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHoratio02">He is the Horatio.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHoratio03">He... they... it is difficult to differentiate.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHoratio04">Spreading themselves across their home system,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHoratio05">Horatio wished to fill it with subjects as beautiful</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHoratio06">…. as the most beautiful thing in the universe.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHoratio07">Himself. Horatio.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHoratio08">Now his goal is to make the entire galaxy beautiful as well.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHoratio09">And he doesn't really care if the galaxy agrees.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHissho01">What we call barbaric ritual, the Hissho call noble tradition.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHissho02">What we call brutal, they call just.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHissho03">What we call slaughter, they call glory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHissho04">The Hissho have an obsession with blood;</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHissho05">whether offering their own or sacrificing an enemy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHissho06">And whether they rule the galaxy and demand tribute from lesser nations,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHissho07">…or die in the effort to do so, they will consider their crusade successful.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesHissho08">For their traditions demand either your blood, or theirs.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSophon01">Some say that victory is worth any cost, </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSophon02">... but only the Sophons would say that about knowledge.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSophon03">They learn from a young age that the universe is a great puzzle,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSophon04">…and are obsessive about uncovering its secrets.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSophon05">Do not look for them at the forefront of battle, for that is not their way.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSophon06">For the Sophons, the only place to take life-endangering risks</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSophon07">…is inside the laboratory.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSophon08">Pedantic, argumentative, and arrogant… but curious, always curious.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesResistance01">Have you stood before the colossal remnants of an ancient civilization?</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesResistance02">Then you may understand how the Pilgrims regard the Endless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesResistance03">Awe, respect, fear... and obsessive curiosity.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesResistance04">Something in those ruins touched a deeper chord than science can,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesResistance05">… and as well as explorers and scientists they are now tattooed mystics.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesResistance06">They cross the stars, to find more systems, more ruins.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesResistance07">To find Tor, homeworld of the Endless.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesResistance08">And their charismatic and passionate  leader</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesResistance09">… will never abandon this quest.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesAmoeba01">The oldest nation that we know of,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesAmoeba02">the Amoeba strive to live in harmony.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesAmoeba03">With nature, </LocalizationPair>

  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesAmoeba05">…and even, in space, with their ships.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesAmoeba06">They have been watching and listening to the stars for ages,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesAmoeba07">… hearing the words of the cosmos itself.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesAmoeba08">For the belief of the Amoeba is to represent all life,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesAmoeba09">… and see that it lives in harmony everywhere in the galaxy.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSower01">They were dropped, ages ago, onto a lifeless rock;</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSower02">...under orders from the Endless they turned it into a paradise. </LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSower03">They are called the Sowers.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSower04">And they seek other planets,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSower05">... to continue their mission.</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSower06">For one day, they are sure, the Endless will return,</LocalizationPair>
  <LocalizationPair Name="%SubtitlesSower07">… and the entire galaxy must be pacified for them.</LocalizationPair>
